In the 1500 square meter spare parts warehouse, more than 24,000 items are now stored on several levels, with the total number of items in the warehouse management software showing over 4 million items. For connoisseurs, the fascinating inventory of the warehouse is like a journey back in time to the pioneering era of motor vehicles and has a calming effect on owners of oldtimers. A clearance of spare parts by the Pierburg company was the foundation stone for the construction of a warehouse for vehicles from the years of construction from 1900 to 1985 Bearing you can look at the carburettor area. In addition to around 12,000 carburettors and carburetor parts from the Pierburg, Solex, Stromberg and Zenith brands, there are also replacement carburettors and a large number of individual parts. In addition to other carburettors from other brands, a flow bench and an additional carburettor tester from Pierburg, some of which were handmade and therefore unique and irreplaceable, could be saved from being scrapped. Throttle valves, units and bearings as well as pumps, valves and floats are present. The area of ​​automotive electrics is not neglected either - with a stock of around 1,000 starters and generators as well as classic Bosch spare parts. Are you looking for rarities?
