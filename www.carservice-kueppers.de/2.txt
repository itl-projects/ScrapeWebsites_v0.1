First, there is a visual check for completeness, wear and damage. After that, an individual cost estimate for the overhaul will be created for your carburetor. Steel attachments are given a new surface protection, sealing surfaces are face milled, out-of-round holes are drilled out and then bushed out. Missing or destroyed parts are made by hand (as far as they are no longer available). As an example, this means that out-of-round mixing chambers are spindled out and new throttle valves are made to match the new, larger diameter. The throttle valve shaft is newly stored. A new original repair kit is installed. Finally, the carburetor comes on our test engine and is subjected to a test run. In this context, it is important for the carburetor to function properly that the carburetor is dependent on the periphery of the engine. For example, a perfect carburetor cannot provide good idle if the valves or the ignition are not set correctly, the timing is wrong, or the intake manifold is leaky. Inadequate fuel supply also causes long-term malfunctions. Original documents as well as tools and test benches make it possible to overhaul carburettors of almost any type. This means, for example: Solex, Pierburg, Zenith, Stromberg, Weber.
