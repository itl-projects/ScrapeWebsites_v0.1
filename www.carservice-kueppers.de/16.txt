In 1965 he started his apprenticeship as a car electrician at a Bosch service and expanded his knowledge after successfully completing it at various Bosch service workshops. This was followed by his first master apprenticeship as a master automotive electrician and further work as a workshop manager at a renowned Bosch service in Aachen. But that was not enough for him. As is well known, a car consists of more than just electronics. The completion of the second master's degree in automotive mechanics was the basis for the foundation of our own workshop in 1981 under the name Bosch Service Küppers on Rurstrasse in the center of Linnich, at which time there were approx. 30 million carburettor vehicles in Germany alone Hans Küppers undertook another specialization and attended several carburetor courses at the Pierburg company in Neuss.

This strategy quickly led to positive results Word of mouth and customers who could not be helped in traditional workshops found the solution to their problems at Car Service Küppers. The classic car enthusiasts with their classics soon showed great interest in this specialist specialization. After this response, Hans Küppers decided to take a bold, visionary step. In 1991, he bought a large number of older carburettors and fuel supply equipment from a Pierburg inventory clearance that would otherwise have been irretrievably lost in order to perfect the service for classic and classic cars. Over the years, so many products, original manufacturing machines, devices and historical manufacturer documents have been collected that a second location was required.
