From November 1st - and even the first weekend after the 2nd Easter Day, it is permitted to use studded tires in Norway. In Nordland, Troms and Finnmark, the corresponding period is 15 October to 31 March. The use of studded tires is also permitted outside this period when the driving conditions so indicate. What is winter? When parts of the road are covered by ice, snow or slack. Simply when there is a risk of slippery driving. Summer tires lose their best properties when the temperature drops - especially the grip. Switch to winter tires well before you really need them. Why take the chance? You can switch to stud-free winter tires as soon as it starts to get cold. Studded tires can be mounted from November 1st. Pattern depth 1.6 or 3 mm? Norwegian law states a minimum of 1.6 mm in summer. For winter tires a minimum depth of 3 mm is required. This applies to passenger cars, light trucks and buses up to 3.5 tonnes (Norwegian Public Roads Administration). Vianor recommends changing both summer tires and winter tires at a minimum 4 mm pattern depth, to ensure sufficient wet properties - which is a lot of that in Norway. Winter tires with less than 4mm pattern depth lose their original drainage properties for snow and slush, and should be replaced. Unfortunately, there are no tires that are particularly safe to use year round. There are winter tires made for the Central European market and often marketed as year-round tires. These tires are designed primarily for driving on bare and wet roads, and somewhat on snowy roads. The tires are often classified as high-speed tires, and have a rubber compound that is less good for Norwegian winter roads (especially grips on ice and snow as well as side grips are weakened). In the summer these tires wear out much faster than summer tires, and also have significantly worse wet grip than ordinary summer tires. For both you and your family - use summer tires in summer and winter tires in winter! Storage of winter tires Winter tires should be kept dark and preferably cool and airy. The most important thing is that they are not exposed to sunlight. We are happy to store your tires in our tire hotel.
