Tire tips that help maintain the field's growing strength As the soil is compacted, density increases and pore volume decreases. Pores of less than 0.025 mm begin to disappear, and no longer form a permanent network in the earth. The physical, biological and chemical properties of hard-packed soil are unfavorable for plant growth. The nutrients are not stored in a form that the plants can use, and the water management is not working properly. The increased need for mechanical soil treatment necessitates more driving on the field, and the soil is subjected to even heavier loads. Heavier machines with higher shaft pressures, due to efficiency requirements, increase the pressure on the ground. The compaction prevents the plant roots from growing deep enough into the soil. At the same time, nutrient uptake is reduced. The plants produce poorer crops - both in terms of quantity and quality - and this weakens the profitability of the production. How to avoid soil compaction? There are generally three ways to maintain the growth power of the earth. An important basic measure is to ensure good water management with adequate drainage. Alternating use of growth change after, say, seven years is another way. This makes the structural bonds in the soil more robust, while increasing the pore volume. The third way to protect the soil is related to the machine's weight and tire selection. Two types of soil compaction are distinguished when working in fields: First, there is the compaction that can occur at high shaft pressure on very moist soil. The compaction takes place in the soil or soil layer under the mechanically treated layer. Secondly, there is the surface pressure or compression of the surface layer caused by the contact surface, too high tire pressure and low loading capacity. It pays to choose the right tire Thanks to significant technological development in recent years, today's agricultural tires enable lower pressure and higher loads when working in fields and fields. With the new tire trunks it is also possible to maintain higher speeds when driving to and from field areas. The new and more flexible tires have a higher air volume, which means that the air pressure can be significantly reduced. At optimum tire pressure, the tire will have a much larger contact surface. This reduces the surface pressure and you can drive on the field without destroying the soil structure. When purchasing tires, make sure that they are suitable for the entire application and based on the technical requirements of the machines (eg with regard to exchange conditions). It is therefore advisable to take the time and get the help of a tire expert when choosing tires. There are also programs on the market that make it easy to compare tires and find the best solution. In Terranimo, for example, you can enter data on the tires, machines and the soil to get a clear picture of the tire's effect and pressure on the soil.
