When it comes time to buy new summer or winter tires, it may feel good to find cheap and discounted tires. However, cheap tires can be expensive in the long run, and can be more expensive to use than high-quality summer and winter tires. On the outside, a cheap tire can look like a premium tire. However, it is not just the tire pattern that affects the properties. The various solutions in a tire with many layers of rubber have a great influence on the tire's performance, durability and rolling resistance. Therefore, a durable tire with low rolling resistance in the long run will be more economical than a cheap tire. Low rolling resistance saves fuel, and not least the environment! Cheap tires often wear out fasterTires that are cheap or heavily discounted should be checked carefully to avoid surprising extra costs when using the tires. Occasionally, discounted quality tires are also sold. For example, slightly older tire models - which are still very safe and of high quality - are often sold at a discount. There are good opportunities to find tire information, because many car magazines and newspapers test tires regularly. Tires that win tests almost always come from a manufacturer known for high quality - even when the test focuses on the relationship between price and quality. A good tire usually lasts longer than a cheap tire because the construction is more durable and high quality raw materials are used in the production of the tire. The rubber compound should be adapted to the tire's use and speed. Tougher rubber blends can be more durable than softer blends, but the driving characteristics change as the guide changes. On a wet or icy road, a soft rubber compound provides safer grip. In general, quality tires can optimize safety and durability carefully, both through tests and in production. When a high quality summer or winter tire lasts a season or two longer than a cheap tire, the price difference in practice becomes much smaller. Rolling resistance When comparing cheap tires and quality tires, one must not forget to look at the rolling resistance. The lower the rolling resistance, the less energy is used for the tires to roll. Choosing low rolling tire reduces fuel consumption. Cheap tires save you money when purchased, but increase costs overall because their higher rolling resistance increases fuel consumption. Manufacturers of quality tires already inform today about how fuel-efficient their summer and winter tires are, although the EU's new rating system will not take effect until November 2012. Inexpensive tire advertisements do not usually inform about the cost of the tires after the purchase. In addition, it can be difficult to obtain information about wear resistance and rolling resistance in tire workshops and in online stores that sell tires, although they greatly affect the total cost.
