By following these rules you ensure long mileage, safe performance and longer service life. Check tire pressure regularly. Different tire pressure between the tires affects the driving characteristics and gives uneven wear. Because the tires wear differently depending on the location, rotate the tire position between the front and rear axles every 5000 to 10000 kilometers. Remember to check the tire pressure when replacing the tire. If the tires are applied so that they roll against the marked rolling direction, the driving characteristics will not be optimal. Drive smoothly. Panic braking and sideways shorten the life of the tire. This is especially true for studded tires. Check if your old tires are unevenly worn when changing tires. The tires wear equally when fitted correctly and run nicely. If the tires are unevenly worn, you should have the vehicle angles measured and a professional repair shop fitted and balanced. about dekkEU tire labeling fuel economy VåtgrepEksternt volume tire tests are viktigeEUs new tire labeling - trucks and buses facts about tires tire side labeling rules and advice dekkHva happens to your tires? facts about tires?
