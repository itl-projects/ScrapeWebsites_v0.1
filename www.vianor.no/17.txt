The standardized classification information is displayed on a sticker that is glued to the tire tread or marked differently. In addition to these three features, there are a number of other factors related to safety, performance, and the environment that truck tire developers focus on, such as: Ice and snow safety characteristics and mileage and tire wear resistanceDriving stability and maneuvering properties depending on driving style. It affects energy efficiency and therefore also the car's operating costs and CO2 emissions. The lower the rolling resistance, the lower the fuel consumption. The energy efficiency class symbolizes the tire's rolling resistance. It shows the extent to which the tires affect the vehicle's fuel consumption and CO2 emissions. The classification categories start at A (green) and end at G (red). Class A is best, class G is weakest. The difference in fuel consumption between two classes is approx. 1-3%. How much you save depends on your driving style. When driving long distances on main roads, you can save most fuel by choosing the right type of tire. During city driving, tires have less impact on fuel consumption. Wet grip Wet grip is an important safety feature, especially for summer tires. It tells about the car's braking performance on wet roads. In the classification A is best and F weakest. Classes D and G are not used. Tires with outstanding wet grip have shorter braking distance, more stable driving and better steering characteristics. The difference in braking distance on wet roads, with a speed of 60 km / h is between two classes (for example BC) 4 - 6 meters The wet grip rating may seem deceptive. The truck and bus tires from Nokian Tires are also intended for winter driving. Check how tires are suitable in winter in Nokian Tire's application recommendations. External tire noise In the new EU tire label, external noise level reduction is considered a very important factor. If millions of cars drive on quieter tires, road noise would also be significantly reduced. The external noise caused by the tires is measured in decibels. External tire noise does not match the noise you hear inside the car, this is not focused on. the tire complies with the upcoming type approval1 black wave = quiet tire, the tire is more than 3 dB quieter than the upcoming type approvalType approvals change in November 2012. Fuel economy and road safety largely depend on the driver's behavior. Note the following: With an economical driving style, you can significantly reduce fuel consumptionSelect tire type according to the purpose and conditions of use. Check that the tire fits in with Nokian Tire recommendations. Air pressure must be checked regularly for optimum driving safety and comfort. Low tire pressure wears significantly more on the tire, affects fuel consumption and poses a clear road safety risk. A responsible motorist is always aware of the tire's characteristics and condition. Only a driver who knows the car and its tires can regulate the speed and distance of the car in front according to the conditions.
