The rolling resistance affects energy efficiency, and thus the car's operating costs and CO2 emissions. The lower the rolling resistance, the lower the fuel consumption. The energy efficiency rating symbolizes the tire's rolling resistance. It shows the degree to which the tires affect the vehicle's fuel consumption and CO2 emissions. The classification categories start at A (green) and end at G (red). Class A is best and G worst. Class D is not used. Savings of up to five full tanksThe difference in fuel consumption between the best and the worst tire is approx. 90 liters per year. The savings throughout the life of the tire will then be approx. five tank fillings (240 liters) * How big are the differences in fuel consumption? A passenger car that has optimal economy class B tires uses approx. 0.1 l less per 10 mil than a car with a Class C tire. The difference between the best (A) and the worst tire (G) in fuel consumption is 0.6 liters per 10 mil. Light rolling tires also reduce the vehicle's CO2 emissions by approx. 14 g / km. » Best and worst. Between Class A and Class G, the savings are up to five tank fillings over the life of the tire. ” Classes in succession, such as B-C, mean a saving of 0.1 liters per 10 mils. * The average consumption of the car is 0.7 liters / mil. Estimated annual mileage 15,000 kilometers, estimated life of the tire 40,000 kilometers. Fuel saving and safety largely depend on the driver's driving style. Note the following: An economical driving style can significantly reduce fuel consumption. Tire pressure should be checked periodically to provide optimum driving safety and comfort. Low air pressure increases tire wear and fuel consumption and is a traffic safety risk. A responsible motorist knows which characteristics the tires on the car and what condition they are in. In order to maintain the correct speed in all conditions, and a safe distance to the car ahead, it is a prerequisite that the driver knows both the characteristics of the car and the tires.
