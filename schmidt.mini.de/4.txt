MINI is now concentrating on the essentials - also when it comes to connectivity. The new version of the MINI Connected app has been fundamentally revised and focuses on driving-relevant functions such as the new, central feature MINI Streetwise or online search. With the new MINI Connected App - available for download now - the journey in the MINI takes center stage. With a view to the essentials, the significantly revised app focuses on driving-relevant functions that provide the driver with important information before and during each tour. The new MINI Connected app consists of the following, partly new functions: MINI Streetwise Online Search Sports Instruments and Force Meter Calendar The basic functions Status, Apps and Profiles Always be one step ahead: with MINI Streetwise. Thanks to the new, central feature of the MINI Connected app, you know the best route to your destination even before you have taken a seat in the British. The app uses personal driving data and displays information such as the duration of the trip and fuel consumption. The Sports Instruments and Force Meter applications make go-kart feeling measurable: the two transfer performance data directly to the MINI Center Instrument, while the online search quickly finds addresses and transfers them to the optional MINI navigation system. Your personal MINI partner will explain more information about MINI Connected.
