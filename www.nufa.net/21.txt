Color: red, fabric: gray / colorful, special steering wheel Atiwe 42, vehicle is lowered by approx. 40mm, approx. EUR 3,000.00 invested in service (new engine, V-belt, etc.), 1st hand, TOP original and condition German papers as well Appraisal report available. With a 200 hp engine, this Lancia will certainly delight its new owner. In spring 1989 a revised version of the Delta HF Integrale 16v was released. In addition to small improvements such as piston crown cooling, the well-known engine now primarily received the newly designed 16-valve cylinder head. With a non-slip surface, 47% of the engine power now went to the front and 53% to the rear axle. The most striking feature of this version was the curved bonnet, so that the higher 16V engine could be accommodated. The 15-inch rims also grew in width from 6 (8V) to 7 inches. The 16V was also recognizable by the new arrangement of the speedometer (the 0 stands at 9 o'clock) and the rev counter (0 at 3 o'clock). This offer is non-binding. Subject to error and prior sale.
