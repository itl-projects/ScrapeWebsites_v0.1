Facts about Dunlop: intelligent tire technology for over 125 years Since 1999 the Goodyear-Dunlop group has consisted of Goodyear, Dunlop, Fulda, Sava and Debica. Dunlop tires stand for innovation and technologies tested in racing. Why Dunlop? The latest tires from Dunlop are partly equipped with Noise Shield technology, a foam layer on the inside of the tire. As a result, the rolling noise can be reduced enormously. This results in a noise reduction of up to 50% in the passenger compartment and thus a significant improvement in driving comfort.Stop by one of our 32 branches or simply order the tires via our online shop.
