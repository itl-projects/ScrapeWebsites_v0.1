The NEW REGULATION (EU) N. 461/2010 which replaces the previous regulation n.1400 / 2002 / CE, known as the Monti Decree, which governs the distribution, repair, maintenance of cars and the supply of spare parts in all countries within the European Union, has the objective of facilitating the principle of free competition in the automotive and assistance sector. The main novelty of this law is that the vehicle, even if under warranty, can be serviced in any independent workshop that operates in a workmanlike manner and no longer only by the official dealers of the manufacturers. At the workshops of the POINT SERVICE network you can perform the coupon of your car, even a new one, without voiding the warranty.
