If the axle geometry is only slightly adjusted, tracking errors occur and there are unpleasant side effects when driving: Up to 80 percent less mileage in the tires Significantly higher fuel consumption left or right-hand drive, poor straight-line running Skewed steering wheel, spongy steering behavior Squeaking when driving through a Curve All of these symptoms indicate an axis adjustment in vehicles and should be examined immediately in a specialist workshop. Typically, the axle geometry is adjusted in the event of collision damage or minor accidents with minor collisions. Even small collisions with another vehicle can be responsible for a lane adjustment. The axle geometry specialists in our specialist workshop can check with a trained eye whether there is a track adjustment. An exact wheel alignment determines whether the toe, camber and caster values ​​comply with the standard. This is how a professional wheel alignment works If your vehicle steers itself in a certain direction, the tires on one side are more worn or the fuel consumption is higher than usual, there could be a lane adjustment. As part of the wheel alignment, our experts therefore first check the tire treads for uneven wear and tear. The subsequent exact electronic measurement of the wheels then provides final information as to whether there is a lane adjustment. The optical-electronic measuring and setting procedure allows us not only to measure the axis geometry precisely, but also to set it correctly again at the same time. In this way, the settings of the axle geometry specified by the manufacturer can be restored in a short time. In technical jargon, there is often talk of camber and toe as part of wheel alignment. The camber defines the inclination of the wheel to the vertical. A positive fall means that the wheel is inclined outwards at the top. The track, on the other hand, describes the difference between the front and rear distance of the wheels on an axle and is usually given in mm. If individual components of the axle geometry are badly damaged, we will be happy to install a suitable spare part in consultation with you. The advantages of a perfect axle geometry You can have a perfect straight running cost-effectively carried out in our specialist workshop. The investment usually pays for itself within a short time, since fuel consumption is reduced and the tires benefit from a longer service life. In addition, the load on expensive components such as the wheel suspension, the shock absorber or the springs is reduced, which saves expensive repairs. Last but not least, you also increase safety for yourself and your passengers. A left or right turn or a spongy steering behavior can lead to devastating accidents in dangerous situations.

If the axle geometry is only slightly adjusted, tracking errors occur and there are unpleasant side effects when driving: Available from: Tire Russ Read more Close × Exhaust service The competent exhaust service from a specialist The exhaust system in vehicles with a combustion engine takes on the task of ensuring that the exhaust gases from the combustion process are safe , environmentally friendly and quiet to the environment. The exhaust reduces the environmental and noise pollution and protects you and your surroundings from the emission of toxic exhaust gases. A defective exhaust system not only affects fuel consumption and can cause serious damage to the engine, but must also be avoided in the interests of environmental protection.

By servicing the brake system, any damage can be identified at an early stage, brake failure is effectively prevented and expensive repairs are avoided. Available at: Reifen Russ Read more Close × Storage Proper storage of tires In order to achieve the maximum possible service life of tires, a careful driving style and above all a professional storage is important. When changing the tires, a whole series of important points must be taken into account in order to avoid long-term damage to the tire and impairment of driving behavior. In addition to the correct ambient conditions and the optimal air pressure, the logical identification and a professional inspection of the tires should also be carried out, for example.
