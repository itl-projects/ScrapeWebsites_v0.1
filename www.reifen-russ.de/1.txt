From a technical point of view, the type of tire represents a compromise between low-consumption summer tires and winter tires designed for adverse road conditions. The all-season tire is particularly suitable for vehicle owners who are mainly in regions with comparatively moderate weather conditions. If the temperature difference between winter and summer is not great, you can do without a second set of tires thanks to all-weather tires and also save the cost of storing the tires. Our experienced tire specialists will be happy to advise you and determine whether all-season tires are an appropriate alternative to two sets of tires in your case. In our specialist workshop you can choose between different models and find the all-weather tires that perfectly match your driving style. Talk to us and convince yourself of the advantages of all-season tires. When does it make sense to use all-season tires? It is decided on a case-by-case basis whether the use of all-weather tires makes sense. Winter tires are specially designed for low temperatures in terms of material composition and contain a high proportion of natural rubber in order to remain supple at low temperatures. The softer design increases the grip and the safety can be guaranteed in adverse road conditions. Summer tires have a lower proportion of natural rubber and are therefore quite hard in winter. In slippery conditions, the tire does not have sufficient grip on the road. All-season tires are a compromise between the two variants and are particularly suitable when there are small temperature differences between summer and winter. The situation is similar with regard to the tire tread. The particularly pronounced profile of winter tires ensures sufficient grip in snow and ice, while summer tires have wiping edges for efficient drainage of water. All-season tires are approved in winter and are particularly suitable in regions where there are no extreme winter conditions. For example, if you are mainly in the big city and can rely on well-cleared streets, you will certainly not go wrong with an all-weather tire. If the road conditions are very bad, however, winter tires are preferable to all-weather tires. In extensive tests on the quality of all-season tires, it was determined which models are particularly suitable as all-weather tires. Our specialists will be happy to make a recommendation and assess whether all-season tires are a good alternative in your case. Below you will find an overview of the advantages of all-weather tires: Cost savings: By not using a second set of tires and the associated maintenance and storage costs, you save money with all-weather tires. Traction: In all weather conditions, all-weather tires offer a sufficient coefficient of grip between the tire and the road. All-season tires are officially approved for winter if they have the "M + S label". Environmentally friendly: All-season tires are an environmentally friendly alternative with high mileage due to the absence of a second set of tires.
