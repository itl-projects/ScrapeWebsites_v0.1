Staffed by a highly experienced team of engineers and technicians based at our Bridgnorth, Shropshire workshops – which currently covers over 40,000 sq ft, plus another 20,000 sq. ft. for bespoke classic car storage – we are able to provide our international clientele with a range of services from a simple oil change, performance and handling upgrades to full restorations and even bespoke car design and manufacture. Over the years, CMC’s experienced engineers and technicians have been trusted with the restoration of many of the most historic Jaguar’s ever built as well as anything from the early Austin Swallow, through to the SS100, XK120, XK140, XK150, MK2, E-type, and XJS models, including regular work on other marques such as Aston Martin, Bugatti, Squire and Lancia, amongst others. We fastidiously restore to original specification on historically important cars or upgrade to client requirements through a vast array of upgrade and conversion options for virtually every aspect of the vehicle.
