Perhaps the greatest benefit is the peace of mind that comes with entrusting my car to people who really know and understand the marque and model and who can invariably go straight to the heart of the problem and fix it without abortive work, saving valuable time and money. The quality of service and workmanship is excellent.” - Gary Emmerson Series 1 E-Type “I like the degree of personal touch and the fact that if you see things that need doing you have no hesitation in doing the minor things or coming back to me and letting me know the price if the things are of an expensive nature.” - David Tringham Series 3 V12 E-Type “In an age when so many facets of society are subject to “dumbing down” – anything will do – it is a privilege to have been welcomed in to a veritable bastion of excellence!” - Tony Rogers Series 1 E-Type IT'S THE DETAIL THAT MAKES THE DIFFERENCE Quick Links Home Meet The Team Media Centre Customer Service News Events Testimonials Gallery Careers Contact Us Services Classic Car Restorations Current Classic Car Restorations Iconic Classic Car Restorations Classic Cars For Sale Classic Car Parts Servicing And Repairs Valeting and Detailing Classic Car Storage Concierge Service CMC Club Contact Us twitter youtube facebook instagram Classic Motor Cars Ltd Building 9 Stanmore Business Park Bridgnorth Shropshire WV15 5HP Tel: +44 (0)1746 765804 Parts: +44 (0)1746 764191 Email: mail@classic-motor-cars.co.uk Contracts of Sale | General Terms & Conditions | Repair & Maintenance Terms & Conditions | Privacy Policy & Cookie Usage
