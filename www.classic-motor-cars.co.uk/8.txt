If you are unfortunate enough to have had an accident, we can take care of your car, using the latest technology alignment systems and paint refinishing. Quality is of paramount importance to Classic Motor Cars and we have a long tradition of repairing both historic and award winning motor cars. Until now our jigs have been specific to classic Jaguars, but with the arrival of the Globaljig system we are now able to carry out all aspects of repair on any marque of classic car to the same exacting standards. Car Storage Being able to store your car with one of the world’s premier car restoration companies in our brand new secure 24,000 sq. ft. facility next to our award winning workshops gives a peace of mind never available before to caring owners. Trimming With a combined experience of over 100 years in the trim department, we cover all aspects of trimming for all makes of classic and sports cars, from the most historic Jaguars ever built to classic Mini Coopers and vintage Bugattis, providing bespoke services using only the highest quality materials. Quality Control Quality is of paramount importance to us. After the final assembly of the car has been completed, we carry out a comprehensive quality control and road testing programme covering a minimum of 500 miles to ensure safety and reliability. Then each car is tuned and set up on a rolling road, allowing us to present the owner with accurate brake horsepower and torque figures. Two days of hand-polishing bring the car to life and leave it ready for the final pre-delivery inspection. Paintwork From our in-house paint shop, we offer a complete service from full re-paints to rectifying minor defects and restoring the paint surface, so that your car looks as good as new, adding value and preserving its originality. Our advanced and intensive paintwork correction services can remove any imperfections permanently, bringing out your car’s true natural colour and shine, along with a long term protection from tar, salt, rain, acid, bird droppings and road grime. Engine Shop We are capable of rebuilding virtually any engine as part of this process we actively encourage our engine builders to talk directly to our clients this ensures we deliver exactly what the client wants.
