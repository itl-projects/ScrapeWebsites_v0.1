After the final assembly of the car has been completed, we carry out a comprehensive quality control and road testing programme covering a minimum of 500 miles to ensure safety and reliability. Then each car is tuned and set up on a rolling road, allowing us to present the owner with accurate brake horsepower and torque figures. Two days of hand-polishing bring the car to life and leave it ready for the final pre-delivery inspection.
