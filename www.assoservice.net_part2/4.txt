Did you know that brake fluid must be changed every two years to keep your brake system in good condition? Although the brake system is perfectly sealed, there is often a drop in the fluid level and this can happen for many reasons: • Worn pads require a greater quantity of fluid • Leaks caused by damage to the system The brake fluid is contained in a special transparent tank positioned in the hood and it is very important to monitor its level (which must always be between two notches: maximum and minimum. When it drops below the minimum level, it is necessary to top it up with something else of the same type). Did you also know that this liquid tends to absorb a lot of humidity deriving from the small porosities formed on the surface of the pipes. During some violent braking, high temperatures are reached which transform the water contained in water vapor, reducing the effectiveness of braking. For this reason, the Asso Service workshops suggest that you change the brake fluid on your car every two years.
