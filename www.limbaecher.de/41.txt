Home / Company history in pictures Company history in pictures 25 years of Limbächer GmbH. The time seems to have flown by when a small, regional used motorcycle trade has developed into a large adventure center for two-wheeler enthusiasts. With much joy and commitment we achieved what we always dreamed of in our youth. It is always nice to see this joy on the faces of the people who come to us for the first time - enthusiastic about the selection and the ambience of our extensive vehicle exhibition. We have compiled a chronicle and a picture gallery that documents what began a quarter of a century ago on the parents' farm in Leinfelden-Echterdingen and grew over the years to become the largest motorcycle house in Germany.
