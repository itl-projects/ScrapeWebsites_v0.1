Home / Questions about the rental Questions about the rental Do you have to pay a deposit? No, it is not necessary. What type of insurance is included in the rental price? Liability insurance, optional comprehensive insurance with excess for an additional charge. Can I drive abroad with the vehicle? Journeys to other European countries (EG) are permitted. How many kilometers are included in the rental price? All kilometers traveled are included in the rental price (except class 9 and monthly rent). What do I do if I have an accident? In any case, the accident must be recorded by the police. The accident report must be signed and completed by everyone involved. In the event of damage occurring without a possible onward journey, the lessee is responsible for covering the costs of the return transport. How many years can I rent a motorcycle? Anyone aged 18 and over with a valid driver's license can rent a vehicle. Can I extend the period during the rental? Yes, provided that the motorcycle is not subsequently rented out to someone else. This must be confirmed by us so that we know and can reserve the motorcycle for you. How long in advance do I have to reserve the vehicle? As a rule, rental vehicles are always available, but if you want a specific vehicle type, we recommend reserving the vehicle approx. 3 weeks in advance. Can I return the motorcycle outside of opening hours? Yes, you can park the rental motorcycle around the clock in the parking lot in front of our building and then throw the ignition key into the mailbox safe at the main entrance. However, we will only take the goods back on the following working day and until then the tenant is also liable for any damage caused by third parties. Many tenants make use of this alternative and so far nothing has happened, but it should be mentioned in fairness to avoid misunderstandings. Can I rent motorcycle clothing / accessories from you? You can rent motorcycle helmets, jackets, gloves, kidney belts, luggage rolls, tank bags and navigation devices from us. Depending on the vehicle type, suitcases are also possible. Additional safety clothing can be purchased inexpensively from our partner shop. Can I rent a vehicle for a longer period, e.g. three months? This is possible after consultation. We would be happy to make you a personal offer for long-term rentals. Can I also purchase a rental voucher from you? Yes, you can purchase vouchers in the desired amount or vehicle category from us. The tenant can then of course switch to other categories for an additional charge. Do I have to check the vehicle technically during the rental period? Before starting each journey, the renter should check the technical condition of the tires, chain, oil, etc. Can I also buy the rental vehicle that I drove? Yes, this is possible after consultation. What documents are required when renting? We need an original ID card and a valid driver's license when handing it over. For non-EU citizens, an international driver's license and a registration address (hotel or similar) are required. What payment methods are possible? Payment in advance by bank transfer or by handing over by EC card, cash or credit card (Visa, American Express or Master Card). Can I rent the vehicle for a day on a weekend? A 50% surcharge applies to the daily price for a firm booking. Last-minute prices are available as of Saturday afternoon, subject to availability - however, motorbikes cannot be reserved here. Does the motorcycle have to be returned washed? No, we do that for you, no matter how heavily the motorcycle comes back dirty. We only reserve the right to complete the return after heavy cleaning, which could possibly cover damage, only after we have cleaned it. Is it possible to store my luggage (trolley / suitcase, etc ...) in the rental station for the duration of the motorcycle rental? Yes, we have lockable cupboards or larger pieces of luggage are stored in a locked room. When planning, please note that you can only get your luggage back within the opening hours if you return the motorcycle. What are the rental periods? Day: 11:00 a.m. to the following day 10:00 a.m. or 6:00 p.m. to 5:30 p.m. the following day. Weekend: Friday 2:00 p.m. to Monday 11:00 a.m. Savings week: Monday 2:00 p.m. to Thursday 7:30 p.m. Week: 7 days max. one weekend including short-term tariff: up to three hours during opening hours.
