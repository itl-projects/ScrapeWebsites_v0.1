Home / Aim high Aim Christoph Fehrle and Fritz Limbächer on the roof of the world. No internet, no contact, no everyday life. A unique trip: The Dane Transhimalaya Trophy - a motorcycle tour that took Christoph and Fritz over the highest pass in the world. At an industry event, they saw pictures of the DANE TROPHY TRANSHIMALAYA for the first time. Six minutes after the presentation, Fritz Limbächer and Christoph Fehrle were on the list of participants. Life is too short to miss the chance for unique experiences. Six months later, a group of 20 motorcyclists started their trip to the Himalayan region. After two days in Delhi, we went by plane to Chandikar and via motorcade to Manali, a mountain town in the border area of ​​the Himalayas. One of the most adventurous motorcycle routes in the world begins there: The Manali-Leh Highway - mentioned regularly among the most dangerous roads on the planet. The trip starts in proper style on the ROYAL ENFIELD BULLET built in India. A somewhat antiquated, but extremely robust vehicle. A 500 cc single cylinder that has been built in a little modified form since 1933. 28 HP, which are reduced even further with every meter of altitude. Exactly the right vehicle for this tour! The journey starts in Manila and the RohtangLa is one of the biggest driving challenges for the team. RohtangLa means "corpse mountain". And once you've left that passport behind, you can understand the naming. 3979 meters high and the entrance to the Manali-Leh Highway. It is only navigable in summer and connects the northwest Punjab with the otherwise cut mountain and border region of Ladakh. The RohtangLa is both a weather and a cultural divide, because it separates the damp, Hindu region of the hilly country from the dry, desert-like, Buddhist region of the high mountains at over 4000 meters. At this altitude, the journey continues in daily stages from 150 to 200 km towards Leh. The multicultural center of the Ladakh region, the "real Tibet". Acclimatized in the meantime, we treat ourselves to a two-day stay in the 15,000-inhabitant city before the actual destination, the highest passable pass in the world, the KhardungLa, is on the timetable. We climb with the Bullets to an altitude of over 5600 m. Staying high is exhausting, the air is thin and some participants have to leave the passport after a few minutes because they see double images and have circulatory problems. Symptoms that should not be ignored given the steep slopes on the right and left of the road. Ultimately, however, we all return to Leh safely. The path then leads us through the fantastic Moonland towards Pakistan to Kargil. At the end of the tour we are still waiting to get into the Kashmir Valley. The last stage starts at 4 a.m. and we experience a breathtaking sunrise at Zoji La Pass in one of the most fascinating regions on earth. In the houseboats on the Jhelam River bathed in golden light, we finally recover from a grueling and unforgettable tour - a "once-in-a-lifetime trip".
