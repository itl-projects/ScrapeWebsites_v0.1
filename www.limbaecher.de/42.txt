Home / Association Yirabah Gambia e.V. Association Yirabah Gambia e.V. Tuesday, July 18, 2017. Limbächer once again supported the Yirabah Gambia e.V. association with a donation this year. This time with a check for 10,000 euros. The funds could be used to build the agricultural training center. In 2012, Limbächer already enabled the Gambia Association to finance a tractor for the Si-Kunda village in The Gambia and was convinced of the sensible investment this was. Today the tractor replaces the laborious manual labor of women in the village and its surroundings. This not only allows larger areas to be cultivated, but also creates new jobs through field work in contract work. The additional acreage now ensures that people are provided with healthy staple food that they could not previously afford and that they make it possible to make a financial sideline in the event of overproduction. The renewed donation of 5,000 euros complements the financing of a solar-powered droplet irrigation system, which includes is funded by the SEZ Foundation of the State of Baden-Württemberg. In the meantime, a well has been drilled on an area of ​​more than 1 hectare, the water of which is pumped into high tanks by means of solar energy and from there distributed as needed via PVC pipes to the vegetable patches. In the future, this will enable year-round cultivation and several harvests a year, which was previously only possible in the short rainy season of around 5 months. According to the Gambian installation company, this is only the second installation of its kind in the whole country. For the Yirabah association, it is the most extensive project to date with a total volume of over € 30,000. The Filderstadt association, which was delighted with the new donation from Limbacher, continues with this project its long-standing strategy of primarily giving local people access to enable self-produced, healthy food and hopes to have once again contributed to the fact that local people no longer have a reason to embark on a life-threatening trip to Europe as so-called economic refugees, the outcome of which in the face of today's conditions is more uncertain than ever.
