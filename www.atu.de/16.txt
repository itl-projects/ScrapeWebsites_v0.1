The Europe-wide labeling requirement applies to all tires produced after June 30, 2012. Evaluation criteria of the EU tire label Fuel efficiency The symbol with the petrol pump stands for the rolling resistance of the tire. The lower the rolling resistance, the less energy (CO2) is used and the lower the fuel consumption. The classification is from class A (green and therefore the highest fuel efficiency) to class G (red and therefore the lowest fuel efficiency), whereby D is not used. Wet grip The rain cloud symbolizes wet grip, which is crucial for driving safety. Tyres with excellent wet grip shorten the braking distance dramatically. The performance is divided into classes A (highest performance, shortest braking distance) to G (lowest safety, longest braking distance), whereby D and G are not assigned. External rolling noise The symbol with the loudspeaker shows the external rolling noise in decibels (dB). The measured value indicates the volume of the passing noise. The more "sound waves" are displayed, the louder the outside noise of the tire. Find out more Find everything for your little ones in the children's world - safety or games in the car! Especially in road traffic, the topic "safety for children" should be very important. Toddlers are often overzealous and adventurous and very quickly get into dangerous situations where it can be dangerous. Henceforth you will not only find bicycles in our children's world, but also also child seats, helmets and the right clothing, including child safety vests and child seats for all vehicle brands, so that the offspring can take part safely on the road. Too often, when buying a child seat, parents are completely haphazard. These valuable lifeguards are often examined and purchased without great demands. Of course, an attractive design doesn't hurt, but first and foremost, generally applicable safety regulations should be met. The path to becoming a specialist is often unavoidable. In our children's world, you always buy high-quality and tested goods that are not only nice to look at, but also serve their purpose. Safety cushions, side impact protection, Isofix and many other important features ensure the safety of the little passengers. Again and again children become victims of traffic because the parents have used safety precautions too carelessly. Prepare in good time so that in extreme cases you don't have to regret anything. If you e.g. If you want to grant independence to ride a bike to school on your own, then at least make sure that your child's health is protected as much as possible. It is always frightening how many children and adolescents would have survived unharmed in an accident if they had worn a bicycle helmet or had been sitting in a safe child seat. Treat yourself to a virtual shopping tour through the children's world of A.T.U today and keep yourself up to date with the latest technology and safety. You don't have to look far for accessories such as reading lights, headrests and booster seats specially designed for children. Go on a journey of discovery and let our wide range of products convince you.
