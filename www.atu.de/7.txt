The Europe-wide labeling requirement applies to all tires produced after June 30, 2012. Evaluation criteria of the EU tire label Fuel efficiency The symbol with the petrol pump stands for the rolling resistance of the tire. The lower the rolling resistance, the less energy (CO2) is used and the lower the fuel consumption. The classification is from class A (green and therefore the highest fuel efficiency) to class G (red and therefore the lowest fuel efficiency), whereby D is not used. Wet grip The rain cloud symbolizes wet grip, which is crucial for driving safety. Tyres with excellent wet grip shorten the braking distance dramatically. The performance is divided into classes A (highest performance, shortest braking distance) to G (lowest safety, longest braking distance), whereby D and G are not assigned. External rolling noise The symbol with the loudspeaker shows the external rolling noise in decibels (dB). The measured value indicates the volume of the passing noise. The more "sound waves" are displayed, the louder the outside noise of the tire.
