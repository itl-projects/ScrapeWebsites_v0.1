Fuel oil deliveries in Belgium Home My house Heating with oil Fuel oil deliveries throughout Belgium: the Total TOTAL network benefits from the expertise of a large network of deliverers throughout Belgium. Thanks to them, we ensure your delivery of fuel oil everywhere and as soon as possible. You can't improvise to deliver fuel oil quickly. This is why TOTAL partners with conscientious oil distributors and deliverers who guarantee the best service. Advanced dispatching for fast fuel oil delivery In order to respond quickly to all fuel oil orders, TOTAL's fuel oil distributors prepare each of their working days the day before, by setting up their dispatching system. In a typical day, all our distributors establish a precise route for their deliverers. This must allow both: to respond to customers' wishes as quickly as possible; optimize the movement of delivery trucks. By properly performing this step, TOTAL offers both fast delivery and an affordable price for the fuel oil delivered, whether it is regular fuel oil, Extra fuel oil or Ultra fuel oil. Fuel oil deliveries at dawn Our distributors' oil deliveries begin their work day at dawn. In this way, delivery trucks can be at the customer's premises at the earliest hour. Note that TOTAL makes it a point of honor to ensure delivery in the most secure way possible, while ensuring that the delivery person postpones a complete assessment of the delivery point in order to avoid any risk of product overflow. Oil, telephone or online emergency orders Many distributors TOTAL offers you the possibility of ordering online or by telephone. They must therefore take into account these two channels to organize their planning. In addition, it is not uncommon for customers to run out of fuel and turn to our suppliers for an emergency order. In this case, they will do their utmost to try to integrate these express requests into the planning of the oil delivery trucks. Do not hesitate to contact one of our distributors for any additional information.
