Cleaning and maintenance of your fuel oil tank Home My home Saving energy Maintaining your oil tank and cleaning It is particularly important to regularly clean your tank. This maintenance brings many benefits and allows you to extend the life of your boiler and save money in the long term. In addition to the maintenance of its boiler, cleaning its oil tank is a good reflex to adopt. This operation avoids a number of inconveniences and also gives the possibility of assessing the condition of its oil tank. Why should I clean my oil tank? Over time, the sediments contained in the fuel oil deposit and accumulate at the bottom of the oil tank to form what is called sludge. These can produce several harmful effects: deterioration in the quality of the fuel oil stored in your tank; disturbance of the proper functioning and performance of your installation, in particular by obstructing the nozzle. Water may also form by condensation in the tank. This causes the appearance of harmful microorganisms for your boiler. How do you clean your oil tank? The cleaning of an oil tank is a delicate operation which must be carried out every ten years by a professional equipped with the appropriate equipment. It includes several stages: the fuel oil remaining in the tank is first sucked up and temporarily stored in a suitable truck; the waste at the bottom of the tank is vacuumed; the tank is thoroughly cleaned; the tank is inspected for signs of corrosion or leaks; the fuel oil is then reinjected into the tank. How do I know if my fuel tank is compliant? The conformity of oil tanks is a regional competence in Belgium. Each region therefore has different requirements, depending on the capacity of the tank and its placement (above-ground or buried tank). A series of elements are generally to be observed: the material of your tank: polyethylene, metal, thermosetting plastic, etc. ; the presence of an anti-overflow system: compulsory in Flanders, recommended in Wallonia; the authorization or the declaration procedure for the tank: not necessary below 3000 liters (in Wallonia) and 6000 liters (in Flanders); the existence of prior checks (for buried tanks). Visit the Informazout website for all the details on the legislation in your region. How to get rid of an oil tank? If you want to put your oil tank out of service, there are a series of rules that also vary according to your region, the size of the tank and its placement. In Wallonia: whether it is an aboveground or an underground tank, you must empty it, clean it, degas it and remove it. If this latter operation is not possible for a buried tank, it should be filled with sand or other inert material. In Flanders: the operations to be carried out are the same as in Wallonia. They must be carried out by an authorized technician who will give you a certificate at the end of the process. In Brussels: the process is the same except that the cleaning waste must be treated by an approved collector. A soil study is requested for a tank of more than 10,000 liters or if pollution has been noted.
