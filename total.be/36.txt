TOTAL fuels for petrol and diesel vehicles Home My vehicle Total fuels for petrol and diesel vehicles in Belgium The fuels distributed in TOTAL service stations were all developed in Total's research center with, at the center of our concerns, the expectations of consumers. TOTAL regularly checks the quality of fuels in its depots. The additives developed by TOTAL research are mixed with the fuel when filling the tanker trucks that deliver the TOTAL stations. Biofuels are added depending on the fuel and the regulations in force. The tanker truck has several compartments and can deliver different products to several service stations. The whole range of Total Excellium diesel fuels Up to 93% less fouling, specially designed to meet all engines Find out more Excellium 98 Up to 99% less fouling, the high-tech lead-free developed by Total. Learn more Excellium 95 Up to 84% less fouling, and compatible with 98% of petrol vehicles built after the year 2000 according to the Belgian Automobile and Cycle Federation (Febiac) Learn more Electric charging Thanks to the rapid charging point network, Total and its partner Allego are making charging stations available to users of electric vehicles. find an LPG point 132 Total Belgian service stations offer you liquefied petroleum gas (LPG). An affordable alternative fuel that is more respectful of the environment. Learn more CNG / LNG Total offers you CNG (Compressed Natural Gas) and LNG (Liquefied Natural Gas) as an alternative fuel in several stations. Find out more But also, your benefits and prices The benefits of Excellium Everything you need to know about fuels Total Excellium Fuel prices Do you have questions about fuels? Why is it important to fill up with TOTAL EXCELLIUM fuels? Compared to standard quality fuels, TOTAL EXCELLIUM fuels offer concrete and proven advantages: Sensitive engine parts remain clean and in optimal condition (eg injectors and valves). The engine is more efficient in all circumstances, such as when starting, on the highway, in town or during acceleration. Fuel consumption decreases immediately thanks to the presence of additives that reduce fouling and internal friction. In the long term, cleaning additives also help keep a cleaner engine. The exhaust gases contain less polluting substances, thanks to cleaner combustion of TOTAL EXCELLIUM fuels and a reduction in CO2 emissions due to lower fuel consumption. I'm driving on gas, should I switch to TOTAL EXCELLIUM? We recommend TOTAL EXCELLIUM petrol for your engine. Thanks to additives, TOTAL EXCELLIUM petrol gives you the certainty that your engine is better protected and runs more efficiently, that you consume less and that you emit less polluting particles thanks to cleaner combustion compared to a non-additive fuel. I run on diesel, should I switch to TOTAL EXCELLIUM diesel? We recommend TOTAL EXCELLIUM diesel for your engine. Thanks to the additives, TOTAL EXCELLIUM diesel gives you the certainty that your engine is better protected and runs more efficiently, that you consume less and that you emit less polluting particles thanks to cleaner combustion. In addition, TOTAL EXCELLIUM diesel guarantees you a quieter engine and refueling is more pleasant (less disturbing smell, less chance that your tank overflows). Can TOTAL EXCELLIUM fuels be mixed with fuels from other brands? Of course, TOTAL EXCELLIUM fuels can be mixed with any type of fuel available on the market which is suitable for your engine, both normal and high quality fuels. After mixing, the benefits will obviously be less pronounced, given the dilution effect. Are TOTAL EXCELLIUM fuels biofuels? TOTAL EXCELLIUM fuels comply with legislation which imposes the limited addition of biological components, as with all fuels for road traffic which are available on the market. I have used TOTAL EXCELLIUM fuel and I do not notice a reduction in my consumption, why? Each vehicle has its specific characteristics and reacts differently to external parameters such as the type of journey, driving style, etc. Many elements also influence consumption, such as the condition of tires (pressure and wear), atmospheric conditions (rain, temperature, etc.), etc. It is therefore very difficult to measure an effect on the consumption of a single vehicle. In official tests, we therefore make use of large fleets over a longer period. The multiplicity of data makes it possible to reduce the effect of disruptive elements on the result of vehicle fleet tests. What is the difference between TOTAL EXCELLIUM fuels and those of other brands of fuel? Since 2005, TOTAL has been selling its TOTAL EXCELLIUM fuels through service stations in Europe and other parts of the world. TOTAL EXCELLIUM is a premium fuel that has had some success. It was born out of a collaboration between the Refining, Marketing and Research departments of Total and is the result of a combination of different factors: experience, knowledge of engines, development of additives, formulation and analysis of products and tests. TOTAL EXCELLIUM is the result of painstaking and long-term work on the product using test protocols in order to be able to show and prove the benefits. TOTAL EXCELLIUM fuels are born from the technology and knowledge of TOTAL research centers. They have been specifically developed to protect motors under the most demanding operating conditions. The formula of the EXCELLIUM additive package is the exclusive property of the TOTAL group. TOTAL EXCELLIUM fuels pay particular attention to: The cleanliness of the sensitive parts of the engine (eg injectors and valves). The engine is more efficient in all circumstances, such as when starting, on the highway, in town or during acceleration. Fuel consumption decreases immediately thanks to the presence of additives that reduce fouling and friction. In the long term, cleaning additives also help keep a cleaner engine. Exhaust fumes contain fewer pollutants, thanks to cleaner combustion of TOTAL EXCELLIUM fuels and lower CO2 emissions due to lower fuel consumption. I drive a truck, is it interesting for me to fill up with TOTAL EXCELLIUM diesel? TOTAL EXCELLIUM Truck has been specially developed for trucks, buses and coaches. TOTAL EXCELLIUM Truck is a product developed on the basis of TOTAL EXCELLIUM diesel technology originally developed for "light commercial vehicles". The use of TOTAL EXCELLIUM Truck is definitely recommended. In addition to the protective features, this fuel also allows you to save money and reduce your cost price per kilometer. Is Total Excellium more recommended for new or old vehicles? TOTAL EXCELLIUM fuels have been developed for all engines. We therefore recommend using it for both new and old engines. The advanced technologies of the new engines place higher demands on the fuel in terms of purity and stability under extreme conditions (pressure and temperature). TOTAL EXCELLIUM fuels are suitable for meeting these technical challenges. Why do you compare TOTAL EXCELLIUM with a fuel without additives? All the characteristics of TOTAL EXCELLIUM have been checked in numerous tests (laboratory tests, on engine test benches and on public roads). All these tests meet European standards, where fuels without additives are always taken as a reference. How many times do I have to fill up with EXCELLIUM before the benefits are noticed? TOTAL EXCELLIUM fuels start to work immediately when they are in your vehicle's fuel system. Repeated use keeps your engine in top condition. Why do you say that TOTAL EXCELLIUM is "technology that goes further"? TOTAL EXCELLIUM fuels have been developed by TOTAL research centers on the basis of the best available technologies. The experience, accumulated over the years in partnership with automobile manufacturers, in particular for the design of fuels intended for competition is also repeated here. Further development was carried out in particular for the following points: The development of a formulation allowing better protection of the motors in ever more demanding operating conditions (higher pressures and temperatures) and a reduction in consumption. Adapting the formulation for an ever-increasing number of biological elements in fuels. Other questions ?
