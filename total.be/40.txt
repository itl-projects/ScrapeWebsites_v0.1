Maintenance of its oil-fired boiler Home My house Saving energy Maintenance of its oil-fired boiler: all our advice Mandatory, the maintenance of your oil-fired boiler is carried out by an approved professional and makes it possible to guarantee your safety as well as optimal performance of your installation. If your home is equipped with an oil boiler, you must have it serviced regularly. But what are the operations carried out during boiler maintenance? What are the advantages of having a well maintained boiler? How much does the maintenance cost? We answer all of these questions below. What is the maintenance of a boiler? The maintenance of a boiler is an operation which comprises several stages and which, like for the maintenance of the tank, must be carried out by an approved professional. It must be carried out every three years in Wallonia and Brussels, and every two years in Flanders. An installation check is also compulsory every year. Maintenance involves several stages and consists mainly of thorough cleaning of the various parts of the boiler. Cleaning the heating body and the hearth Using suitable products or a chimney sweep, the heating engineer who performs the maintenance of your boiler will first of all clean the heating body, the hearth, and all the elements that they include (inspection hatches, doors, walls, etc.). He uses an industrial vacuum cleaner to collect the pieces of soot that come off during cleaning. Cleaning the burner The burner is the part of the boiler that burns the fuel oil. It is therefore particularly important that it is in good condition. During maintenance, the technician will make sure of it and make sure to clean it thoroughly. It will also clean the oil filter with which your burner is fitted. Control of the nozzle The nozzle of a boiler conveys the fuel which will be burned. It is an element which is sensitive to wear and which is therefore one of the parts most often replaced during maintenance of the boiler. If the part does not have to be replaced, it will be cleaned by the technician. Chimney sweeping The last operation which will undoubtedly be part of the maintenance of your boiler, the chimney sweeping of the fumes produced by the boiler is carried out using chimney sweeps. It helps rid the duct of excess soot that accumulates there to ensure your safety and avoid overconsumption. Why do you need to maintain your boiler? If a boiler maintenance seems expensive to you - between 130 and 220 euros approximately -, know that it is about an operation which brings many benefits to you: the certificate provided by the heating engineer at the end of the maintenance is often requested by insurance in the event of a problem (fire, etc.); a well-maintained boiler will consume less and therefore save you money: you gain 5 to 10% efficiency by having your boiler regularly serviced; a well-maintained boiler is safer: less risk of chimney fire, CO poisoning, etc. a well maintained boiler lasts longer. For all these reasons, the maintenance of the boiler is not only a legal requirement, but also a gesture full of common sense.
