The prices of the fuels that you find in your TOTAL service station in Belgium are influenced every day by different factors. Decryption. In Belgium, official fuel prices are determined each working day by the Federal Public Economy Service, on the basis of what is known as the program contract. Service stations cannot charge a higher price than that set by the Belgian government. However, they can offer their customers a lower fuel price if they wish. These maximum rates include different components. Some of them fluctuate. They thus make the price of fuels at the pump move up or down. So how do gasoline and diesel prices break down? The cost of the ex-refinery product The main element that drives the prices of fuels from day to day is the price of the ex-refinery product, that is to say diesel or gasoline straight out of the refineries of oil. This currently represents 30 to 35% of the prices of diesel or petrol paid at the pump. It varies according to: the valuation, on international markets, of the raw material which composes it, namely petroleum; the euro / dollar exchange rate; the cost of refining, an operation which transforms petroleum into diesel or petrol; supply and demand for gasoline and diesel. A distribution margin for fuel suppliers To this first amount is added the distribution margin granted to tankers and suppliers. This share must allow them to cover the various costs of transport, storage, delivery of fuels but also costs related to marketing and promotion of products. Determined by the Belgian State in absolute value per liter of fuel, this gross margin is fixed: it does not therefore increase or decrease according to the price of the ex-refinery product. Its share in the price of final fuel is 10 to 12%. Contributions and excise duties levied on the price of fuel The Belgian State then levies three contributions on the price of fuel. These meet very specific objectives: APETRA (Agence PETRolière - PETRoleumAgentschap): this contribution aims to ensure security of supply for Belgium, in other words, that the country always has a sufficient minimum stock of oil and petroleum products; BOFAS: this support fund performs soil remediation at service stations in Belgium; the energy contribution. At the same time, excise duties are withheld. They are also established by the Federal Public Service, in absolute value per liter of diesel or petrol. These different charges are equivalent to just under 40% of the price of fuel at the pump. A 21% VAT on fuel prices Finally, there is also the VAT, currently 21% in Belgium. It applies to all of the above elements. In 2018, value added tax represented approximately 17.5% of the price of fuel as it appears to the customer at a service station. Taxes, contributions and excise duties thus account for more than half of the price of diesel and petrol paid by the consumer at the pump. The Total fuel range offers superior fuels at its service stations. TOTAL EXCELLIUM, Diesel and petrol fuels are the result of TOTAL know-how.
