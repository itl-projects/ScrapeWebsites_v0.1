Oil level and draining your motorcycle Home My vehicle Engine oils Motorcycle advice Motorbike: oil level and draining Regularly draining the engine oil of your motorcycle is an essential step in ensuring its proper functioning. We explain how to do it yourself, but also how to check the oil level and choose the lubricant best suited to your machine. Engine oil has an even more important role in a motorcycle than in a car. Indeed, in a two-wheeler, it also serves to lubricate the gearbox and the clutch, while ensuring some of the engine cooling. Regularly checking the oil level, changing the oil and using an oil that is perfectly suited to your motorcycle as a replacement or as a backup are essential actions. How to check the oil level of your motorcycle? In a motorcycle, the casing is located at the bottom of the engine block. The lubricant is sent to the engine through a pump and gravity brings the oil back into the crankcase after the engine has stopped. The oil level therefore varies if you measure it immediately after the engine is turned off or a few minutes later. To measure the oil level of your motorcycle, be sure to go through these different steps: do not start the engine to avoid splashing oil and avoid distorting your measurement (the oil being in circulation in the engine) ; if you have driven for at least 15 minutes, wait 10 minutes for the oil level to return to normal; place the motorcycle upright on its stand; identify the “MIN” and “MAX” mark on the housing or on the gauge; top up if necessary so that the oil level is located right between the two marks. How to drain your motorcycle? By circulating in the engine block of your motorcycle, engine oil gets dirty. This used oil must therefore be replaced. Doing this yourself is a relatively simple process. You just need to follow these few steps: place your motorcycle in an upright position; run the engine for a few minutes to thin the oil; place a container under the housing and open the housing cap; dismantle the oil filter and replace it with a new filter, making sure to tighten the drain screw with a new seal; close the crankcase cap and fill with new engine oil until the correct level is reached. What type of oil to choose for your motorcycle? There are different types of engine oil, each more suited to a particular type of motorcycle and riding style. These oils are available in different viscosities. Mineral and synthetic oils While mineral oil is obtained from the distillation of fossil fuels, synthetic oil is obtained by more refined refining. This process makes it possible to obtain molecules of the same size, for less friction and, therefore, less wear. In addition, synthetic oils contain more additives (antioxidants, detergents, etc.). These characteristics therefore make them more resistant to higher temperatures and pressures, as is the case in high performance engines. The viscosity of engine oil Our ELF brand offers a wide range of engine oils for two-stroke and four-stroke motorcycles and scooters. Use the manufacturer's instructions to determine the correct oil viscosity to use for your motorcycle model. The viscosity of the oil - in other words its fluidity - is most often expressed, on cans of engine oil, in two grades located on either side of a letter "W" ("Winter"). The first number (before the "W") indicates the viscosity when cold, the second (after the "W"), the viscosity when hot. A 5W40 engine oil therefore has a viscosity index of 5 cold and 40 hot. Which oil to choose? To stop hesitating in front of the service station shelves, you can now use our online recommendation tool: in just a few clicks, it tells you which engine oil is most suitable for your car or motorcycle.
