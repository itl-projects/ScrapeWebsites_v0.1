Braking Home - Braking Complete control of your braking system by Point S Playing an essential role in securing your driving, the braking system is designed to slow down the vehicle and allow it to stop in the event of danger or obstacle on the road. It is composed of several elements: discs and brake pads for "disc brakes", or jaw drums for "drum brakes". In addition to this basic system is added the Anti Blocking System , the ABS device, which monitors the rotation of each wheel using internal sensors and an electronic computer. The purpose of this system is to preserve the maneuverability of the vehicle if emergency braking is to be carried out. All of these elements are subject to wear, over time and the use of the car, and must therefore be checked regularly to guarantee your safety and that of your passengers, as well as the safety of other road users, motorists and pedestrians alike! A check every 15,000 to 30,000 km, or every year, is recommended depending on the model.
