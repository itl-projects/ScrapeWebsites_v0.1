Hybrid Home - Hybrid Point S, partner for the maintenance of your hybrid carThe hybrid car is an excellent compromise between economy, performance and ecology On average, the overhaul and emptying of a hybrid car is carried out every 15,000 kilometers for a hybrid petrol engine, compared to 10,000 kilometers for a hybrid diesel engine. Reliable and autonomous, the batteries are generally guaranteed between 5 and 10 years. Savings can be made depending on the hybridization of the vehicle (micro-hybrid, full-hybrid, plug-in, etc.). Energy recovery during braking and deceleration increases the longevity of the braking elements. The specifics of this technology require the expertise of Point S approved professionals to maintain your hybrid car. COMPLETE AND RELIABLE MAINTENANCE OF YOUR HYBRID VEHICLE Certain parts of your hybrid vehicle are common to those of a thermal car. This is particularly the case for suspensions, tires or even the lighting system. However, dual engines require rigorous know-how in terms of car maintenance and handling of electrical circuits. Your Point S car center has the various approvals necessary to intervene in a secure and reliable way on hybrid systems. Our experience and knowledge of the mechanics of many models allow us to perform interventions on the engine environment, as well as on the mechanical (or electrical) peripheral parts of hybrid or classic cars. Point S experts are able to carry out a technical pre-inspection while ensuring the necessary repairs. In order to offer you an accurate and reliable diagnosis, measurement operations and proper functioning tests can be carried out by our teams. Do not hesitate to visit the nearest Point S center to find out more.
