Shock absorbers Home - Shock absorbers CHECK YOUR SHOCK ABSORBERS AT POINTS FOR SAFE TRAVELComponents of the vehicle suspension, the shock absorbers are responsible for keeping the tires in contact with the ground and absorbing the shocks caused by deformation of the pavement while driving. Therefore, they play an essential role in ensuring the safety and comfort of the driver and passengers. They also play an important role in the handling of the car when cornering, emergency braking, and driving on a wet road. However, like all the elements linked to the ground contact function, the shock absorbers wear out over time. Especially since they can be used up to 5,000 times per kilometer! However, pronounced wear of these elements is likely to cause an extension of the braking distance, poorer handling, and accelerated degradation of the car tires. This is why the shock absorbers must be checked every 20,000 km approximately, and replace them every 70,000 to 100,000 km depending on the model. The springs and suspension kits must be renewed at the same frequency.
