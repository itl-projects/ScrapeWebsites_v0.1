Services & Services Home Restoration Services & Services Contact Service & Services We are happy to make special specialties. A large number of trades that other companies cannot or only inadequately manufacture inspire us with their individuality. Be it the new or reconstruction of convertible top linkage, new manufacture of seat spring cores, trimmings of trimmings and coat rope or the purchase of wheelchairs and other auxiliary and rehabilitation aids. Every part is unique! We are not averse to "strange" wishes such as the manufacture of a Viking tent or a padded tunic. Challenge us with your wishes. individual and special requests Of course we can also customize vehicles. In addition, complete conversions of the interior, such as a Ford Transit, which became a rolling multimedia office, come into question. But also cover smaller individual items such as the steering wheel of a VW Sharan with leather in carbon look. We also realize custom-made products that do not actually exist. We manufacture leather steering wheels for Mercedes-Benz Sprinter and V-Class almost as standard. Aids and rehabilitation aids (tailor-made wheelchair upholstery) We deal with the manufacture of tailor-made wheelchair upholstery to enable our customers to have safety and comfort in everyday life. <1 - 24> DER OLDTIMERSERVICE Moerser Stra√üe 75 47803 Krefeld 02151 3 61 21 38 02151 3 61 21 39 info@DerOldtimerservice.de We are a member of: MVC Mercedes-Benz Veteranen Club von Deutschland eV VdH Association of Tail Fin Friends SAH Society of Automotive Historians TNNR The Nordic Nash Register AUVC Auto Union Veteranen Club Founding member of the BVOF Bundesverband der Oldtimer-Fachbetriebe OK This website uses cookies.
