DPF’s usually remove 85% or more of the soot. In addition to collecting the particulate, a method must exist to clean the filter. Most filters are designed to burn off the accumulated soot through the use of active technology, such as a fuel burner which heats the filter to soot combustion temperatures, through engine modifications. The engine is set to run a certain specific way when the filter load reaches a pre-determined level, which will oxidize the particulates at relatively low temperatures. This is known as ‘filter regeneration’. The first indication of a fault is usually the EML (Engine Management Light) coming on. If you have a problem with the DPF not regenerating, then the alternative may be a forced regeneration , much cheaper than replacement costs of anything up to £1000. We have the necessary equipment and software to carry out these tasks at considerably less cost than DPF replacement.To find out more about our Diesel Particulate Regeneration in Witney, get in touch online or call us directly on 01993 771286 Cambelts Find out more » Car Air Conditioning Find out more » Car Batteries Find out more » Car Brakes Find out more » Car Collection & Delivery Find out more » Car Exhausts Find out more » Car Gearbox Reconditioning Find out more » Car Gearbox Repairs Find out more » Car Modifications Find out more » Car Repairs Find out more » Car Safety Checks Find out more » Car Servicing Find out more » Car Tyres Find out more » Car Welding Find out more » Cheap Car Tyres Find out more » Classic Car Repairs Find out more » Classic Car Service Find out more » Clutch Replacement Find out more » Commercial Repairs & Servicing Find out more » Electric Car Find out more » Engine Diagnostics Find out more » Engine Management Find out more » Fuel Contamination Drain-Off Facility Find out more » Fuel System Cleaning Find out more » Hybrid Find out more » Mechanical Repairs Find out more » MOT Find out more » Motorhome Repairs Find out more » Shock Absorbers Find out more » Vehicle Recovery Find out more » Wheel Alignment Find out more » Wheel Balancing Find out more » MOT BookingBook your MOT online with Old Mill Motors, it's really simple...Book MOT »Book ServiceBook your service online with Old Mill Motors, it's just a click away...Book Service »Check MOTCheck if you've got a valid MOT, it takes no time at all...Check MOT »EnquiryGet in touch with us.
