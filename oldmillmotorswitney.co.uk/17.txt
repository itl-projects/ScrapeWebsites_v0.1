As with most mechanical parts these systems need regular checks and servicing. We offer a complete range of services to ensure your system is running cleanly and safely. These range from anti bacterial clean to a full leak test and repair.Air conditioning systems don’t just remove heat from the air entering your vehicle, it also removes moisture.When there’s a lot of moisture in the air it can make the conditions uncomfortable and cause visibility issues when window mist up.When conditions are wetter with snow and rain, moisture is transfered into the cabin by its occupants. when the heater is used this will evaporate the moisture causing the windows to steam up.Using the air conditioning will reduce or eliminate this so it is important that you have this maintained.To find out more about our Car Air Conditioning in Witney, get in touch online or call us directly on 01993 771286 Cambelts Find out more » Car Batteries Find out more » Car Brakes Find out more » Car Collection & Delivery Find out more » Car Exhausts Find out more » Car Gearbox Reconditioning Find out more » Car Gearbox Repairs Find out more » Car Modifications Find out more » Car Repairs Find out more » Car Safety Checks Find out more » Car Servicing Find out more » Car Tyres Find out more » Car Welding Find out more » Cheap Car Tyres Find out more » Classic Car Repairs Find out more » Classic Car Service Find out more » Clutch Replacement Find out more » Commercial Repairs & Servicing Find out more » Diesel Particulate Regeneration Find out more » Electric Car Find out more » Engine Diagnostics Find out more » Engine Management Find out more » Fuel Contamination Drain-Off Facility Find out more » Fuel System Cleaning Find out more » Hybrid Find out more » Mechanical Repairs Find out more » MOT Find out more » Motorhome Repairs Find out more » Shock Absorbers Find out more » Vehicle Recovery Find out more » Wheel Alignment Find out more » Wheel Balancing Find out more » MOT BookingBook your MOT online with Old Mill Motors, it's really simple...Book MOT »Book ServiceBook your service online with Old Mill Motors, it's just a click away...Book Service »Check MOTCheck if you've got a valid MOT, it takes no time at all...Check MOT »EnquiryGet in touch with us.
