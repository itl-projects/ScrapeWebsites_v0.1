View our services OUR ADVANTAGES Fast service Specialized craftsmanship Years of experience in the sector A replacement car during the repair of your car Very correct prices Strict observance of every appointment HISTORY Fashion Car bvba is a family business with a long history! Activities in the sector started for the managers in 1971, when they started a business in auto mechanics and body repair with their brothers. In 1984 both departments were separated and Fashion Car bvba was founded as an independent business under the leadership of 3 of the 5 brothers. Until 1995 Fashion Car bvba was active on the South Docks of Antwerp. The plan arose to move to an industrial zone in order to continue to guarantee optimal service to customers, and in the end Fashion Car bvba moved to a modern, completely newly furnished building in the Industrial Zone Polderstad of Hoboken. In the same place, the three managers have since guaranteed you a personal involvement in every repair, a smooth service with a standard replacement car during the repair and, of course, thorough and specialized craftsmanship based on years and years of experience.
