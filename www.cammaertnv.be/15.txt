This structure has been built with all elements that appear in the ISO 9001 standard, the label that we have been wearing since 2008. We therefore strive to at least meet the requirements of this standard. It is important for the continued existence of our company to pay due attention to our services and the way in which this is done. Continuous improvement is a key value in the success of our company. We must have the courage to be self-critical and keep looking for opportunities to improve. This is the only way we can get better. Our main concern is always to give our customers a practically workable solution to the emerging problems. Customers should never feel that they have not been provided with a perfect solution - every vehicle and service has to respond optimally to the customer's needs. In order to offer you an optimal service, we attach great importance to the quality of our services. For example, our staff regularly attend technical training courses. In this way, our employees are aware of the latest trends in the field of mechanics and the electrical field. However, these training courses are not optional. The acquired knowledge is tested in practice and provided with the necessary feedback. We also have the necessary diagnostic equipment and know-how to maintain your vehicles in a professional manner. Day after day we continue to strive for optimal service, with and for our customers.
