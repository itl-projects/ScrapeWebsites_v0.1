More and more companies are therefore opting for sustainable mobility. One of the options for reducing your carbon footprint is driving on natural gas. CNG (Compressed Natural Gas) or compressed natural gas offers you the opportunity to drive sustainably and still travel long distances with just one refueling and with the same driving comfort. The benefits of natural gas are endless. First of all, natural gas is cheaper than traditional fuels, which results in a lower kilometer cost. Moreover, the government levies less excise duties on natural gas and you can count on various additional tax benefits in many countries. In addition, a CNG vehicle produces about 50 to 75% less noise. Two to four natural gas engines produce the same noise as one diesel engine. This means they can also be used for night work and, for example, in city centers. In short, choosing natural gas is not only a sustainable choice, but also guarantees a responsible corporate image.
