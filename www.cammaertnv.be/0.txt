We lose in him a real entrepreneur and the founder of the Cammaert group. We will miss his dedication and warmth forever. We can't really summarize it better than this: His case was his life Now it's time for rest Because of the current situation, with the measures taken against the corona virus, the funeral continues in intimate family circles. When the tribute for Willy will continue we will let you know as soon as possible. 06/03 / 2020Also in yellow the new S-way looks beautifulAnother delivery of the new S-way, this time in yellow! 28/02 / 2020The date for the 8th Cammaert Classic is known: June 7, 2020. The previous edition can be described as a great success! We raised no less than € 7190 for the VZW Stop Colon Cancer. This means that we last year more than 700 participants! Of course we also aim for a new record number of participants and a record amount for charity this year. Last year's family tours were also a success, they will certainly be further developed. The tour is ideal for those who have forgotten to train for the 70km and still like to take a ride. The tour is accessible to children and is ideal to take with an electric bicycle. We also do not change our success formula. Just like last year, the Cammaert Classic is accessible to every cycling enthusiast. You can quickly traverse the ride accompanied by cars and motorcycles. But the tours are also signposted, so you can choose to drive at your own pace. The family tour is not guided and is therefore driven at your own pace. The starting places will not change either, we can still be found at: - Cammaert Trucks Sint-Lieven-Houtem Polbroek 44 9520 Sint-Lievens-Houtem - Cammaert Trucks Gooik Ninoofsesteenweg 48 1755 Gooik For those who would not yet know the Cammaert Classic: We have 2 guided rides in the offer of 70km and 100km, you can choose where you start these tours (Gooik or Sint-Lievens-Houtem). On the way, a stop is made at the other starting point for a short supply and you end up at the location where you left. If you choose to do the rides under supervision, be sure to be on time! We leave promptly at 8am and you really don't want to miss breakfast! We do ask to register as soon as possible. This way we can make better preparations, so that everything runs smoothly.

We are already looking forward to it and hope to see you on June 7, 22/01/2020 The first orders of the new S-way are in full delivery!
