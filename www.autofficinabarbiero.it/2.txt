This technology was developed by a Modenese engineer who after years of studies and having always worked in this wonderful world of engines has precisely put this device that allows to treat combustion engines internally. This treatment is carried out on any internal combustion engine but we have gained experience mainly on cars, commercial vehicles, heavy vehicles (trucks, bulldozers, excavators, etc.) and finally scooters and motorcycles. The treatment consists in making the engine suck a mixture of gas (the prevailing one is hydrogen), completely transforming the main source of the instrument which is distilled water without adding additives for an hour and a half and then we go on test with the customer . The gas mixture acts mainly on the carbonaceous residues that have formed and deposited over time with the work of the engine and remains in the metal walls for a benefit calculated for 20,000 KM. At the time of treatment, all the components most subject to the accumulation of carbonaceous residues FAP-EGR are touched and consequently they are released avoiding their breakage or clogging. The thing we appreciate most is that there are no post-treatment contraindications because no piece is damaged with the gases introduced and no pieces of carbon residue are detached but they are softened by the gases and are expelled with the normal operation of the engine. The main benefits are: Recovery of engine power lost due to the kilometers traveled Unlocking and cleaning of the FAP particulate filter Optimization of gear changes Abatement of exhaust gases 90% Variation in the engine's delivery curve the car becomes smoother and more drivable Consumption reduction of at least 10% Mechatronics Tire change convergence Authorized revision center Washing of injection system Recharge air conditioner Maintenance of automatic transmissions Calibration of ADAS cameras Mobile workshop and tow truck BARBIERO CSA SRL Via Fornace 137 36050 Bressanvido (VI) Tel. 0444660518 Fax 0444660518 VAT: 04179540242 info@autofficinabarbiero.it INSTALLATION CENTER Cookie Policy Back to top Powered by Fas-net Full Communication Group - all rights reserved
