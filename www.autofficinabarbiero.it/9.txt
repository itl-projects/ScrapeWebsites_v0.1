When carrying out maintenance operations, a diagnosis of the car and / or commercial vehicle is carried out as a first step in order to understand if there are problems not detected by the customer. We then proceed to replace the exhausted filters with new ones. Another important step in routine maintenance is the draining of old oil from the cap of the oil pan; in this way any impurities that cannot be removed using only the inspiration technique are eliminated. Before proceeding with the insertion of new oil, the type of oil to be inserted is checked in the database, so that it guarantees the correct functionality of all the engine parts. At the end of the whole procedure, all the other fluids (brake oil, wiper fluid, antifreeze, etc.) are checked and eventually restored.
