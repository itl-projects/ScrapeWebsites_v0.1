The first check that is carried out is on the components that make up the system: they must be in good condition and that they function correctly. Once these parameters have been ascertained, any gas leaks are checked with the appropriate instrumentation. As a last step, we proceed with a visual check of the cleanliness of the heat exchanger (radiator) and the subsequent charging of the system. When refilling the air conditioner, we recommend replacing the cabin filter (if not previously replaced). Upon request, the internal ducts of the passenger compartment are sanitized.
