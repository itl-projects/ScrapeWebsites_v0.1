They can also take advantage, on the order of the relevant Mayor, also of special discounts for access in the ZTL. The Mixed-Fuel Diesel system is an alternative automotive system for Diesel engines from 2 to 16 cylinders. The entire system was developed on a cutting edge technical solutions platform that allows the mixing of air and gas which, in turn, are then mixed with Diesel inside the cylinder. Furthermore, the installation of the Mixed-Fuel Diesel system does not prevent driving exclusively with Diesel fuel, as it does not involve any interference with the original engine parts. The Mixed-Fuel Diesel system allows the use of diesel energy that is normally not used. The operating principle is very simple: in diesel injection engines, the gas is injected directly into the manifold, improving the combustion of diesel in addition to that of gas, with a consequent increase in engine power. We list the main benefits: Economic Savings: estimated in a range from 20 to 40% Mixing of Diesel up to 70% Significant reduction of polluting emissions: between 20 and 40% Freedom of Circulation: where required by the individual Municipal Administrations Same performance : Torque / Power and Driveability Autonomy: compared to the original one by adding the second fuel Mechatronics Tire change convergence Authorized revision center Washing of the injection system Refill air conditioner Maintenance of automatic transmissions Camera calibration ADAS Mobile workshop and tow truck BARBIERO CSA SRL Via Fornace 137 36050 Bressanvido (VI) Tel. 0444660518 Fax 0445660518 VAT: 04179540242 info@autofficinabarbiero.it INSTALLATION CENTER Cookie Policy Back to top Powered by Fas-net Full Communication Group - all rights reserved
