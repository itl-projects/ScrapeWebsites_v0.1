Due to its long drive-on ramps, our low loaders are ideal for rolling stock such as electric coaches. We can extend the two-piece bed, making the loading bed 17450 mm. Due to the integrated twist-locks, the low-loader can also be used for the transport of containers with over-height or flats. The height of the deep bed at maximum load is 425 mm. KDSnv has all permits for too wide, too long or too heavy transport throughout Europe. Please contact us to discuss the further details of the low-loader transport.
