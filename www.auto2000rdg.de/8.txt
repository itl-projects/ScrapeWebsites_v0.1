It is usually not necessary to replace and repaint the corresponding body part. On the basis of a comprehensive damage analysis, we mutually agree which repair work would be necessary and should actually be carried out. Of course, we also discuss the expected costs of the repair as well as possible alternatives. If the body is very damaged, it is usually necessary to replace the affected parts and straighten the entire body with subsequent painting. We pay attention to the best possible approximation to the original paint of your vehicle. Of course, we only use original parts from the brand manufacturers.
