For more than 40 years now, the name SARHOLZ has been a guarantee of knowhow in the motorcycle industry. Sarholz was the first official importer for ATVs / quads in Germany. Until 2010 he also worked for the Honda brand in the automotive and power equipment segments, and in 2005 KTM was brought on board. We are now KTM dealers and offer the complete range of KTM models. We have also been selling HUSQVARNA motorcycles since 2017. In addition, for over 20 years, the Sarholz name has also been a constant in the motocross scene. Front places at the World Cup, many international and national titles speak a clear language. The youth work, which is still in the foreground, has spawned a variety of talents, such as Max Nagl, the Vice World Champion from 2009 in the World Cup, to name just one example. We look forward to your visit RACE CALENDAR No Iframes OPENING HOURS Mon-Fri 8: 00-12: 30 13: 30-18: 00Sa 8: 00-12: 30Tel +49 2664 8844 Facebook KTM Sarholz HAPPY CUSTOMER | Nassauer Strasse 19 | 56479 Niederrossbach | Telephone +49 2664 8844 Imprint Data protection Back to top We use cookies on our website.
