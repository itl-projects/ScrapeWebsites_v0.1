Request a mobility guarantee? Fill in the form below and we will contact you. Send Mobility guarantee location determination We launch a handy location determination tool. It is timeless; you are stranded with your broken car and you really have no idea where you are. It is always a challenge for the emergency responders of the AutoFirst Mobility Guarantee to determine your exact location. Recently they have been supported in this by a handy location tool that we developed ourselves: GPS by SMS. This tool is immediately added to our services for free! How does it work The principle is simple. If you contact us and do not know exactly where you are, the care provider will send you a text message. All you have to do is open the message and click on the included link. The social worker will see a map with the location on his screen, including street name and number. He can then send the help with that information to get you back on the road or (in the worst case) to refer you to the nearest hospital. Emergency center The AutoFirst emergency center is available 24 hours a day, 7 days a week! Telephone number: (0031) 0570783517 Tips in the event of a breakdown Ensure your safety and that of the occupant (s). Never sit in your vehicle along the road, use your warning triangle and wear safety vests. When you contact the emergency center, your location is important, make sure it is known.
