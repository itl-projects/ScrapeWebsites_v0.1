Although the sun has been shining frequently lately, temperatures fluctuate a lot and can even reach freezing at night. Despite the sometimes still low temperatures, we recommend that you change your winter tires in time for summer tires. Here are some reasons for a timely change: Above 7 degrees more grip compared to winter tires Above 7 degrees better road holding compared to winter tires Winter tires wear faster at higher temperatures A timely change prevents waiting times Save on fuel costs Combine the tire change with an air conditioning service! We check and clean all parts of your air conditioning system. All fungi and bacteria are killed with a special cleaning agent. The remainder of the coolant is drained and completely changed.
