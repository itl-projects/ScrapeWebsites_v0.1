A properly functioning braking system is essential for safe road use. We recommend that you have your brakes checked regularly. What types of brake discs are there? When should you have brake discs and / or brake pads replaced? New brake discs? New brake pads! What are the costs for replacing brake discs? Warranty What types of brake discs are there? There are two types of brake discs; the normal solid discs and the ventilated double brake discs that can cool better. Until a few years ago, the ventilated brake discs were mainly used on heavier and sportier cars. Today, small cars are also increasingly equipped with this variant. When should you have brake discs and / or brake pads replaced? Wear occurs with both solid and ventilated discs. Over time, the surface of the discs becomes bumpy and the brake pads wear out. Your car has a warning light that comes on when your brake pads are worn. A beeping sound when braking is also a signal to have your brakes checked. Just like when you can press the brake pedal very far, the brake feels bumpy or when the steering wheel vibrates when you brake. If your car brakes less well, it is in most cases caused by worn brake pads. But also brake discs do not have eternal life. New brake discs? New brake pads! If the condition of your brake discs is too bad, have them replaced. Brake discs are always replaced both left and right. We also install new brake pads at the same time for optimum braking. In some cases, the wear indicator also needs to be replaced. What are the costs for replacing brake discs? AutoFirst Aart Terpstra works with A-quality parts, such as Brembo and Bosch.
