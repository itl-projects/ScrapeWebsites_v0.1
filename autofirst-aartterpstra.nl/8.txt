Reason for us to not only supply excellent used vehicles, parts and accessories, but also to provide service in the form of maintenance and damage repair. Major service We advise you to offer the vehicle to us for maintenance according to factory specifications, for example at 15,000 km or at least once a year. During a major overhaul, we check your car from headlight to taillight and everything in between. We ensure that your car is back in top condition and ready for the next few kilometers. You can combine the major service with the MOT inspection. Small turn During the small turn we change the oil, the oil filter is replaced, we check the other filters and refill liquids if necessary. Of course we also check the tire pressure. You can combine the small turn with the MOT inspection. Summer service If you drive a lot of kilometers with your car and take it on holiday with it, for example, we advise you to bring your car to us for a summer service. We then check the braking system because of the often high load on the braking system during the holidays. In addition, we also check all liquids and tire pressure. After the summer turn you can go on holiday safely and confidently. Winter service In winter it is very important that your car continues to function under all (severe) weather conditions - such as snow, sleet or (severe) frost. We will not leave you out in the cold. By winterizing we mean a thorough and professional control of, among other things, the fluids of the cooling system and windscreen washer system. The electrical system, such as the battery that provides less capacity due to frost, is also checked, making it difficult for your car to start. Of course we do not forget the tires.
