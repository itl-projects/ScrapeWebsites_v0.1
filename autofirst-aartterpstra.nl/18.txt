When should you replace the tires? Tires have a maximum life of six years. Due to dehydration and aging, small cracks occur and the grip of the rubber deteriorates quickly. For safety reasons, you should then actually replace the tire. The age of the tires is indicated on the sidewall of a tire. The last 4 digits of the DOT code indicate the production date. The code consists of four digits; for example 1508. That means that the tire was produced in week 15 of the year 2008. During an APK inspection, the tires are assessed at a minimum tread depth of 1.6 mm. Furthermore, tires on one axle must have the same size and carcass structure. Finally, they are also checked for damage and bulges. How do you keep your tires in good condition? It is advisable to check the tire pressure once a month. The tires must not have warmed up yet. You can find the recommended tire pressure on the inside of the driver's door, in the owner's manual or on a sticker on the inside of the fuel filler flap. Depending on the use, a different tire pressure is required. A heavily loaded car requires higher tire pressure than a driver-only car. Try to limit as much as possible driving up and down curbs, speed bumps and other large bumps. Also keep an eye on the wear of the profile. Check for even wear. Isn't that the case? Then visit AutoFirst Aart Terpstra. Puncture? Is your tire flat and have you not been driving on it for long? In such a situation, AutoFirst Aart Terpstra can usually repair and balance the tire perfectly. That saves you another unwelcome expense. RunFlat tires Some cars now have RunFlat tires. With this tire you can continue for 80 kilometers after it has been punctured. The cheeks of these run-flat tires are so sturdy that you can easily reach the nearest AutoFirst Aart Terpstra at a maximum speed of 80 km / h. The manufacturer of your car determines whether RunFlat tires can be fitted. All cars equipped with RunFlat tires have a tension control system on the dashboard. This warns the driver as soon as there is a voltage drop. It is possible to replace RunFlat tires with standard tires, but it is not recommended. Balancing tires Well-balanced tires are important for road holding and your driving comfort. In addition, both tires and suspension wear less quickly and you save considerably on fuel consumption. If your steering wheel vibrates at a certain speed, there may be an imbalance in one or more wheels. Then visit us to rebalance your tires. Align your car Do you have the impression that your car is pulling to one side? Chances are your car needs to be aligned. The wheels are then not straight with respect to the car. This skew of the car is not only unpleasant when driving, it also causes faster tire wear and higher fuel consumption. Your AutoFirst Aart Terpstra can solve this problem in half an hour. We advise you to have your car realigned in the following cases: Once a year or every 20,000 kilometers. After a collision. After replacing a wheel bearing. After purchasing new tires. After hitting a hole or curb. Changing tires You drive safer and have better road holding when you change the tires every 15,000 kilometers. We then place the tires with the best profile forward. Most cars have front-wheel drive, which makes the front tires wear out faster. By changing regularly, your tires wear more evenly. Tire storage You are happy with the purchase of your winter tires. But where do you leave them in the summer? And vice versa, you suddenly have the same challenge with your summer tires. AutoFirst Aart Terpstra offers a solution. We store your tires in our storage for a small amount. Compare or order tires in the AutoFirst Aart Terpstra tire webshop Ordering your new car tires online is safe, easy and fast in our tire webshop. To compare the correct tires, it is important that you enter the correct tire size. On the side of your current tire is a combination of three numbers; the length, width and rim size.
