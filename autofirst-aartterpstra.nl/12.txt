Warranty on repairs How do you notice that the clutch is broken? A well-known signal is that it is starting to slip; the car hardly accelerates when you release the clutch. Even if you accelerate a dot while driving and the car does not accelerate or slow, a wipe is a sign. Also have your clutch checked for a while when shifting becomes difficult or the clutch pedal feels heavy or gets higher. Alarming noises when you hold the clutch pedal down may indicate a worn clutch pressure bearing Why is it wise to have the clutch checked when in doubt? Driving too long with a worn clutch can damage other parts. The repair will be more expensive. In some cases, replacement can be delayed for a while by having it adjusted again. What is the expected life of a coupling? A clutch can last up to 200,000 or more kilometers. Much depends on the operation and the type of mileage. Intensive use is not beneficial for the lifespan. Do you drive a lot of short distances, are you often stuck in traffic or do you often drive a trailer or caravan? These are all circumstances that cause the part to be replaced sooner. What will be replaced? During the repair we replace the next to the clutch plate, the thrust bearing and the pressure group. These parts have experienced the same number of kilometers and are therefore in the same bad condition. There is a great risk that they will also break down in the foreseeable future. Your experienced AutoFirst Aart Terpstra mechanic will also check the status of the flywheel, crankshaft, drive shaft and pries shaft seals.
