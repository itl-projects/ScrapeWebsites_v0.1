Does your car have a start / stop system? Different car batteries are available for modern cars with a start-stop system. It is important that the correct battery is selected when replacing. In micro-hybrid cars, the car engine is turned off as soon as it stops before a traffic jam or traffic light. The car radio and the lights just stay on. As soon as the car accelerates, all energy is required and when the car brakes, the alternator stores the braking energy. A car battery for a start / stop car is therefore not constantly 100% charged like a standard battery. It still works well with 60%. The AGM (Absorbent Glass Mat) batteries are perfect for this. Thanks to rapid developments, there are now more and more cars with a start / stop system. Especially in the cheaper segment. Usually no braking energy is generated with these cars. Therefore, less demands are placed on the batteries. These cars are usually equipped with an ECM (Enhanced Cycling Mat) car battery or an EFB (Enhanced Flooded Battery). AutoFirst Aart Terpstra.
