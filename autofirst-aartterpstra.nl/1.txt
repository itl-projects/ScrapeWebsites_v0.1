In the video below we show you the difference of winter tires, all season tires and summer tires, during the winter period. 8 Reasons to Choose Winter Tires. Winter tires have more grip at temperatures below 7 degrees. Thanks to a special rubber compound with silica, they remain flexible and elastic for longer. Winter tires dissipate rain, melt water, hail or wet snow much better due to the fine blades in the profile. This shortens braking distance and also improves cornering handling. With winter tires you have less chance of aquaplaning. The profile of the winter tire grabs well during snowfall. So you also have more grip with snow. Are you going on winter sports? The use of winter tires is now mandatory in many European countries. You can be fined or in the worst case you will have problems of liability and personal injury.

And the cost for winter tires is about the same as for summer tires. So you are hardly more expensive at the bottom. If you use winter tires from November to the end of March, the risk of an accident due to slippery conditions is much smaller. It is a much safer option for yourself, your loved ones and your fellow road users. Are winter tires mandatory or not? Winter tires are not mandatory in the Netherlands.
