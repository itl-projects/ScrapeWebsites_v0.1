The General Periodic Inspection (APK) is a statutory inspection in Europe to promote road safety and to protect the environment. In the Netherlands, the inspection obligation is described in the 1994 Road Traffic Act and regulations derived from it. According to these regulations, you must have your passenger car, or company car that - loaded - not heavier than 3,500 kg, inspected annually. That is, if the car is three years or older. Heavy commercial vehicles, trailers and semi-trailers must be inspected annually from the age of one year. The MOT is a snapshot and does not guarantee that your car will remain safe to drive for the rest of the year and that you will not have to carry out maintenance for a year. Regular inspection and maintenance of your car therefore remains important. When should your car be inspected? The so-called "date of first admission" is decisive for the inspection. This date is stated on registration certificates issued after 1 January 1995. For registration certificates issued before this date, the date of first admission is usually the date of issue of Part I of the registration certificate. A passenger car or delivery van must have been inspected for the first time three years after this date and every year thereafter. Heavy commercial vehicles must have been inspected for the first time one year after the said date. You can have the car inspected from two months before the inspection date. If the car has not been inspected or has not been inspected in time, you may be fined. At the MOT, the inspector pays attention to the following parts, among others: Traffic safety Brakes, suspension, shock absorbers, tires, steering, lighting and bodywork Environment Exhaust gases General Registration certificate part I, vehicle identification number and the fuel used. APK Tips Before you offer your car for an inspection, you can already check the following points: Is the windscreen washer filled? Does the horn work? Lighting: check that the brake lights, main beam and dipped beam work correctly. Do the belts work? Are the wipers not worn out? Are the brakes and handbrake still working properly? Is the exhaust defective? License plate light (two lights, both must be lit) Do you have any questions?
