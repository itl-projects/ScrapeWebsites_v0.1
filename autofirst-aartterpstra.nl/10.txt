That is normal and not something to be concerned about. It is therefore advisable to check the oil level monthly. You can get the right oil for your car from us. We can also check the oil level for free. Tip 2: Checking and refilling windshield washer fluid Windshield washer fluid ensures that your windows are wiped clean if your windshield is dirty. In addition to the cleaning effect of the windshield washer fluid, it also contains an anti-freeze agent. This ensures that in the cold winter months the windshield washer fluid does not immediately freeze during use, causing dangerous situations (windshield freezes and obstructs vision). Stop by if in doubt, it can lead to dangerous situations. Tip 3: Checking your wipers If your wipers no longer sufficiently clean your window, squeak or have stripes, it is time to replace your wipers. It can often be seen from the windshield wiper itself, when it is worn out. The wipers will then show dryness cracks, or the rubber will peel off on the outside of the wiper. Windshield wipers are car type dependent. So make sure that the new wipers are suitable for your car. Tip 4: Check and top up coolant (do not do this!) It is better not to do this yourself, because depending on your car there are cold and warm barrels. This makes it dangerous to check and / or refill yourself. In principle, it is also not necessary to top up your coolant. We recommend this by stopping by. Tip 5: Check & pressurize the tire pressure Correct tire pressure is more important than you may think at first. The only part that connects your car to the road is your tires! Tire pressure that is too low is bad for fuel consumption, but also for road holding. In addition, a soft tire gets hot quickly, which increases the chance of a blowout. Tire pressure that is too high, on the other hand, is not good either. This also results in poorer road contact and increased tire wear. You can always drop by for a free tire check.
