In Europe we are the first manufacturer of lift trucks and one of the largest companies in the production of equipment for tire specialists and for diagnostics (vehicle control and wheel alignment). Founded in 1958 to build equipment for repair shops, Ravaglioli continued uninterruptedly to develop all aspects of lifting, both as regards cars and commercial vehicles. Over 350,000 lifters, only of the "two columns" type, distributed in all parts of the world testify to our specialization and importance achieved in this sector. Another fundamental aspect of production is that of tire repair equipment, managed by a special organization, both in the design phase and in the testing and production phase. The diagnostic sector represents the great commitment and the great success of Ravaglioli in recent years.
