Bar products and industrially manufactured bikes are not our thing. We attach great importance to the quality and aesthetics of the bicycles we offer. Wheels with steel frames have proven themselves millions of times over 100 years, we see no reason to change the classic appearance and geometry. When selecting the components, we do not follow the latest fashion, but only use products that have been tried and tested on the market for a long time. Even the “hidden” weak points on the wheel (hubs, bearings, cables, tires) are not touched down by us with the red pencil. All these measures guarantee you a high quality bike for daily use. Of course, this effort is also noticeable in the price, but the added value in terms of service life and driving pleasure justifies this difference by far. Our bikes also require maintenance and care, which is why we are always available in our shop. A 24-hour workshop service and a rental bike for this time are, of course, a matter of course. If you are interested in one of our bikes, please bring enough time and clothing suitable for cycling. After all, all seduction bikes want to be tried out and all questions regarding their intended use and individual equipment clarified.
