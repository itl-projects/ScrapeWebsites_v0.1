They are all grouped in the APCAP (associação Portuguesa das Sociedades Concessionárias de Auto-Estradas or Pontes com Portagens). In Portugal, the toll system is "closed", that is, you will find an entry and exit barrier. But dealers also use a gantry toll system over highways (there are no more barriers to cross, your badge is detected automatically). In the event that you have to cross a toll barrier, lanes are reserved for holders of the electronic badge, offered by AS 24, in partnership with the Portuguese concessionaire. Your AS 24 toll solutions in Portugal: how it works The AS 24 PASSango electronic badge is accepted on the entire Portuguese road network. In addition, it can also be used on French, Spanish or Belgian roads! To subscribe, simply sign the PASSango contract as well as the badge request form.
