Concretely, it is a tax paid by road users. All vehicles must be in possession of the sticker before entering the country (or just after the border). CNADNR is responsible for the operation and maintenance of the Romanian motorways. In addition, some bridges over the Danube are also subject to tolls (such as the Giurgiu-Rousse bridges and the Fetesti-Cernavoda bridge). Your AS 24 toll solutions in Romania: how it works The toll system applicable in Romania is evolving! There is no longer a physical sticker (affixed to the windshield). E-stickers can be purchased online or at a petrol station. You can buy a sticker for a specific period in advance (1 day / 1 week / 1 month, etc.). Control is automatic and takes place at fixed points equipped with cameras. It can also be carried out by mobile agents. With AS 24, road users can obtain the sticker only via the Customer Area with their EUROTRAFIC card.
