To respond to this new regulation, AS24 proposes to equip trucks over 3.5T with a Toll Pass OBU thanks to a Eurotrafic contract. Your AS 24 toll solution in Bulgaria: how it works Vehicles exceeding 3.5T are all eligible for the toll tax. The price per kilometer depends on the weight of the vehicle, the number of axles, the emission standard. The prices can be viewed on www.bgtoll.bg.Do not wait and order an OBU Toll pass via AS 24 by contacting your customer service. You will receive it wherever you want in the EU. The OBU, an easy and simple to use system For those who travel often, the easiest and most comfortable way to pay tolls is to equip the truck with an OBU. When the vehicle is moving, the OBU detects and sends geographic positions in real time, thereby automatically detecting the entry, exit and movement of the vehicle on the paid road network. The OBU transmits the position data obtained to the TollPass system via a mobile connection. Obtaining an OBU is very simple: Contact your AS 24 customer service who will register your company and your vehicles for you. Once registered, customer service orders the OBUS you need. Your badges will be sent to you a few days later. late everywhere in Europe The advantages of AS 24: Simplify your procedures: AS 24 manages your OBU registration and orders for you A single supplier for tolls and fuel in Bulgaria Daily transactions are available in the AS 24 customer area Product AS card 24 EUROTRAFICMaterializationDescriptionThe card which gives you access to the toll and station networks in Europe.
