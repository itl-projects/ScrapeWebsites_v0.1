The AS 24 fuel card: a technology at the service of the security of your data To refuel your heavy goods vehicles and access all the services, AS 24 provides you with cards with enhanced security. Thanks to EMV technology, the chip cannot be copied. The risk of fraud is therefore reduced: all your expenses are secure! How does the AS 24 card work? There is no human intervention between the pump and billing: access to fuel is fully automated. the AS 24 network, for any fuel transaction, the personal identification code (PIN) must be entered beforehand. (You can configure the PIN code for each of your cards) .A real-time authorization request is sent to the AS 24 central server, which then allows access to fuel or other services in the event that the card is valid. If this is not the case (blocking of the card, exceeding the ceiling, etc.), the transaction is impossible. Thanks to the possibility of setting ceilings, you limit the risk of misuse. AS 24 guarantees you secure transactions as well as full control of your fuel cards, available at any time, via your Customer Area. The cards are valid for 3 years.
