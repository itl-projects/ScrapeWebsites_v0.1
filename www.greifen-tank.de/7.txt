Air conditioning service | Greifen Tank GmbH Greifen Tank GmbH 038328-70745 welcome In most cases, this is due to a lack of maintenance and care. In the course of years of use, air conditioning systems lose coolant due to natural shrinkage, which leads to a drop in performance. Therefore, the coolant should be replaced every 2 to 3 years. If the air conditioning system has not been used for a long period of time, this can lead to brittle seals and thus leakages. With the help of a contrast agent, we make them visible and remove the defect immediately. We can service air conditioners with the refrigerant R134a and R1234.
