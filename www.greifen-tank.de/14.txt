Cabrio roof maintenance. That's how it's done. | Greifen Tank GmbH Greifen Tank GmbH 038328-70745 welcome That's how it's done. 04/27/2020 Convertible tops are exposed to strong sunlight and weather in summer. If the roof is to last and look good, it must be cleaned and impregnated thoroughly at least twice a year ... Instructions: Be careful with strong pressure washers, which can cause damage. Spray the wet roof with the convertible roof cleaner and let it work. Then clean the soft top evenly with a cleaning brush. Simply rinse off or drive into the car wash. Impregnation is recommended after cleaning. Of course this is available from us. Feel free to contact us.
