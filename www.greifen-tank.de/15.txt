At the end of the 1000 km, the car goes into emergency running with reduced power. What is AdBlue anyway? To meet the Euro 6 standard for diesel vehicles, the VW Group has developed vehicles with SCR catalysts. These break down nitrogen oxides with the help of AdBlue, which consists of 32.5 percent urea and 67.5 percent demineralized water. The chemical is odorless and non-toxic. Usually, AdBlue is checked and refilled in the inspection interval. If you get this error message earlier, come to us. We fill up the AdBlue tank again.
