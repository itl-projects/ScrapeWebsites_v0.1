This is noticeable by a left or right spin and unevenly worn tire treads. This often results in increased tire wear and fuel consumption as the rolling resistance of your tires increases. Regular wheel alignment in our workshop allows us to identify and correct even minor deviations from the optimal straight-ahead run. Our employees use modern technology to check your suspension settings. In the first step, we examine the contact surfaces of the tires to get a picture of the settings of the chassis. Then the wheel geometry is measured precisely and the various influencing factors are analyzed. We compare the determined data with the specifications of your automobile manufacturer and then carry out the fine adjustment of the axle geometry. The straight running of your vehicle now restored ensures a longer service life for your tires and reduced fuel consumption.
