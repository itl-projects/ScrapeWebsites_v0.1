Glitch on the highway. | Greifen Tank GmbH Greifen Tank GmbH 038328-70745 welcome 04/27/2020 Damage on the highway can happen quickly. The tire breaks, the electronics fail, or another part loses its spirit. Panic arises, because you often hear about accidents in such situations. We have advice for you on the correct handling in such situations. As soon as something is wrong with the car, you should switch on the hazard warning lights to warn other road users. 2. If the car is still driving or coasting, try maneuvering on the hard shoulder. 3. Now that the safety vest has been put on, the warning triangle must be placed 150 meters in front of the standing car. 4. For your safety, all vehicle occupants must leave the car and go behind the guardrail. 5. Then you can call the police and a towing company. By the way: Since 01.07.2014 it is compulsory to carry the safety vest. If you don't have a safety vest yet, ask us.
