Spring cleaning for the car. | Greifen Tank GmbH Greifen Tank GmbH 038328-70745 welcome 04.05.2020 Despite the very mild winter, winter services have spread road salt again. Road salt is particularly aggressive and promotes rust formation on the vehicle. That is why we recommend cleaning the car thoroughly after the winter. This prevents rust. The spring cure for the car begins with a thorough exterior wash. Start with the pressure washer to remove coarse dirt. Only then should washing brushes be used. Then you should examine the paint. Small paint damage can usually be repaired with a paint brush to prevent rust. Thirdly, the windows should be cleaned. Inside and outside. The moisture in winter often leaves its mark. It is advisable to also check the windscreen wipers. Iced windows often damage the rubber lip. As a last point, the interior should be cleaned thoroughly. Of course, you can also get all the necessary cleaning products from us. Give us a call.
