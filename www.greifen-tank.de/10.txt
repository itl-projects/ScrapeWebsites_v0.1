Reduce the loss of value with the inspection | Greifen Tank GmbH Greifen Tank GmbH 038328-70745 WelcomeAbout usServicesAxis measurementVehicle diagnosticsInspectionAir conditioning serviceMotorcycle repairTire serviceUncustomer serviceTrailer repairVehicle salesTank stationContact & directions With the inspection reduce the loss of value 04.05.2020 The maintenance intervals for new vehicles are longer compared to earlier. Improved components lead the driver to believe that the inspection is unnecessary. However, during the main inspections, significant defects are found in every sixth car. The brake is a common component, although it contributes to the safety of the driver, and oversleeping the inspection often means consequential damage to other components. Because the complex interplay in the vehicles is growing, the lack of an entry in the service booklet also leads to losses when the vehicle is sold. It does not matter to us whether your vehicle has a digital or electronic service book or a paper service book.
