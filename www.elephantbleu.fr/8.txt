Two wheels Motorcycles and 2 wheels: Welcome to the ElEphant Bleu car wash stations The Eléphant Bleu car wash stations are universal: beyond cars and utility vehicles, the high pressure washing tracks are equipped to accommodate 2, 3 and 4 wheelers: bikes , scooters, motorcycles, trikes ... With a fragile fairing, nooks and crannies difficult to access, 2 and 3 wheels are difficult to wash. High pressure washing is the ideal system for this type of vehicle, subject to some precautions. The lance allows you to control the gesture while avoiding sensitive areas, to insist on the dirtiest areas, to follow the curves of the fairing and to reach the underbody of the vehicle. All the Blue Elephant washing tracks are specially designed for this type of vehicle with simple but practical features to facilitate washing.For bikers: in the center of the water drainage grid, a surface in the shape of a Blue Elephant is provided to support the stand and ensure the stability of the vehicle. For cyclists: a special MTB grating helps keep bikes in balance during washing. In some centers, a helmet holder is installed on the washing tracks. Occasionally, specific products are offered for sale in Blue Elephant centers equipped with a shop, such as wipes for cleaning the visors of motorcycles and helmets. Tips for optimal and dry washing Use the Neiman contactor to lubricate or oil to prevent water from entering. Remove the antennas and fold down fragile parts such as the indicators. To polish the varnished rims and the discs, use the rim washer option. Spray the product with the low pressure lance and leave to act for a few minutes. Wash the motorcycle fairing by keeping the lance approximately 1 meter from the vehicle to avoid lifting the seals. Wash from top to bottom, to avoid micro-scratches and dirty the parts that have already been washed, from the least dirty to the dirtiest. Avoid passing the high pressure lance over the electrical elements: commodos, harness, alternator and ignition housings, lighting. Do not insist on places where water could seep in. Use the drying option, especially on chrome to preserve humidity and avoid the risk of corrosion. On hard to reach surfaces, use alcohol vinegar diluted to 50% and pour the mixture into a sprayer. Caution: The automatic washing gantries are not designed for 2 and 3 wheels which are too fragile. Only high pressure washing will be effective and safe for washing motorcycles.
