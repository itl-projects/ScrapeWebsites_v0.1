The CNPA, the National Council of Professionals Automobile, presents in the video below the journeys of Jean and Léa which illustrate the ecological impact of home washing and the challenge of regular and controlled car washing: A major ecological issue Water is at heart of not re profession, we preserve it! Water is a vital and perishable resource, help us to preserve it. With Blue Elephant, take the side of our planet, Blue Elephant, manufacturer of washing station and initiator of citizen washing, works to offer motorists services that allow them to respect the environment as much as their bodywork. The brand is committed to preserving water resources through its development strategy that respects the planet and people. Inherent in its strategy, sustainable development is one of the founding values ​​of the brand and is available in all areas where it operates, from the design of its facilities to its actions of partnerships and communication. Because it is effective, controlled and avoids passive pollution, washing in specialized stations is a civic act. Washing outside the washing center and the absence of washing leads to active and passive pollution with dramatic consequences on the environment because the pollutants accumulated on the body are discharged into nature. As a reminder, article L 1331-10 of Public health code stipulates that "Any discharge of wastewater other than domestic in the public collection network must be authorized beforehand". Active pollution: wild washing, vehicles washed in the streets or at home without treatment of discharges. Passive pollution: unwashed vehicles because oils, hydrocarbons, heavy metals and tire residues are rinsed off by rain, penetrate the soil and pollute the groundwater. Washing your vehicle at the Blue Elephant station also reduces up to 80% water consumption compared to washing at home. Home washing is a major source of water pollution. Based on a frequency of 7 washes per year, the Blue Elephant Industry Department estimates the quantity of pollutants contained in the washing water at 95,000 tonnes. Among the polluting substances: 26,000 kg of hydrocarbons 457,500 kg of iron63 kg of cadmium586 kg of phosphorus1,499 kg of chromium246 kg of boron1,291 kg of manganese1,560 kg of barium1 108 kg of nickel1,433 kg of lead What to pollute 95 million m3 ! Or about the consumption of drinking water in homes in an agglomeration such as Lyon or Marseille. New portal: ecological technology. Faithful to its values ​​of washing quality and respect for the environment, the brand has found a technological response to offer the automatic washing service.

At Blue Elephant, all the discharges are treated on site, in the station which, by itself, is a real treatment station. All the centers are connected to the "wastewater" network which is reprocessed before being returned to the natural cycle. High pressure washing: significant water savings 100% waste control Control of the volume of washing water used: possibility of interrupting washing temporarily using the washing key. 80% water saving 300 liters of water on average for a water jet wash against 50 to 60 liters for a high pressure wash. 100% of waste treated In our centers, the hydrocarbons are recovered in a separator and then treated.
