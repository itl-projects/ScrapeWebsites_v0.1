IMPACT ON Washing stations: Following government announcements (decree of March 15, 2020) to prevent the spread of the Covid-19 virus, washing stations are not affected by the closure measures. For certain vehicles such as ambulances or taxis which continue to operate, access to washing may indeed be necessary. To date we are awaiting clarification from the government. Prefectures and town halls have locally requested the stations to be closed of washing. We of course strictly comply with it, and we recommend that you comply with the legal and regulatory provisions. As soon as the situation is clarified with the government we will get back to you. Until then take care of yourself and your loved ones. Hygiene gestures to adopt in a washing station: If, for professional and hygienic reasons, you need to wash your vehicle, we recommend the following gestures during your visit to the station: Disinfect your hands with using a hydroalcoholic gel before and after your visit to the station.Avoid contact within a meter of any other person present on the station.Our shops being closed we ask you to kindly equip yourself with gel hydroalcoholic, disposable handkerchiefs or gloves before going to the resort. As a reminder, the washing stations: Are not and must not be a place of assembly or gathering. The activity is, and must be in "self-service". There is no staff except maintenance staff on the station. The activity is intended for cleaning and contributes to hygiene, especially for road professionals, medical transport and food transport. thank you for giving priority to medical and professional vehicles and refer to the containment and movement rules published by the government.
