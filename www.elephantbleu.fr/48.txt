Automatic washing Automatic Washing of your car In order to ensure the cosmetic and beauty of your automobile, our washing stations offer automatic washing gantries with pre-washing of the brushes exclusively at Blue Elephant. This option appeals to turnkey car wash enthusiasts with the satisfaction of a brilliant result in a reduced time and without risk for the bodywork. Several years of research have been necessary to develop an automatic washing system for vehicles that can match the washing quality of the High Pressure system, while avoiding the micro scratches generated by the friction of the brushes on the bodywork. The self-cleaning of the rollers at high pressure is a patented Blue Elephant exclusive. Its secret is to combine high pressure technology with automatic washing to pre-wash the brushes. They then become harmless to the bodywork and optimize the quality of washing.The Blue Elephant washing gantry is simple to use, efficient, quick and respectful of the bodywork. Depending on the condition of the vehicle, a choice of 6 programs is available in Blue Elephant centers equipped with automatic washing: Program 1: The Express Self-cleaning of the rollers + Body and wheel washing + Anti-fingerprint rinsing The Express is recommended for washing regular. Program 2: The Essentials Self-cleaning of the rollers + Body and wheel wash + Anti-fingerprint rinse + Optimal drying The optimum drying option will avoid the risk of water marks left on the body while driving. Program 3: Extra-Self-cleaning of the rollers + Active foam + High lateral pressure + Body and wheel washing + Anti-fingerprint rinsing + Optimal drying The Extra is suitable for washing moderately dirty cars with slightly persistent soiling. Program 4: Brightness Self-cleaning of the rollers + Active foam + High lateral pressure + Body and wheel wash + Underbody and rim wash + Anti-streak rinse + Optimal drying The Brightness is ideal for cars with particularly dirty rims and underbody.
