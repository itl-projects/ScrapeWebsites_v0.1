The information does not refer to a single vehicle and is not part of the offer, but only serves for comparison purposes between the different vehicle types. * Note according to Directive 1999/94 / EC: The fuel consumption and CO2 emissions of a vehicle depend not only on the efficient Use of the fuel by the vehicle, but are also influenced by driving behavior and other non-technical factors. CO2 is the main greenhouse gas responsible for global warming. A guide to the fuel consumption and CO2 emissions of all new passenger car models offered in Germany is available free of charge at any point of sale in Germany where new passenger cars are exhibited or offered or at www.dat.de. Since September 1, 2017, certain new vehicles have been type-approved according to the Worldwide Harmonized Light Vehicle Test Procedure (WLTP), a new, more realistic test method for measuring fuel consumption and CO2 emissions. Since September 1, 2018, the WLTP has replaced the new European driving cycle (NEDC), the current test procedure. Because of the more realistic test conditions, the fuel consumption and CO2 emission values ​​measured according to the WLTP are in many cases higher than those measured according to the NEDC. At the moment, the NEDC values ​​must be communicated. ** Optional equipment at extra cost. *** Ford SYNC 3 with AppLink and touchscreen is the consequent further development of our communication and entertainment systems. The system can be operated even more intuitively thanks to an expanded voice control and the new, capacitive touchscreen with a 20.3 cm screen diagonal.
