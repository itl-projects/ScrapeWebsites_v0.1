Please contact us for more information and availability details. * Note on fuel consumption and CO2 emissions: The specified values ​​were determined in accordance with the prescribed measurement procedure (Section 2 Nos. 5, 6, 6a Car EnVKV in the currently applicable version). The information does not refer to a single vehicle and is not part of the offer, but only serves for comparison purposes between the different vehicle types. * Note according to Directive 1999/94 / EC: The fuel consumption and CO2 emissions of a vehicle depend not only on the efficient Use of the fuel by the vehicle, but are also influenced by driving behavior and other non-technical factors. CO2 is the main greenhouse gas responsible for global warming. A guide to the fuel consumption and CO2 emissions of all new passenger car models offered in Germany is available free of charge at any point of sale in Germany where new passenger cars are exhibited or offered or at www.dat.de. Since September 1, 2017, certain new vehicles have been type-approved according to the Worldwide Harmonized Light Vehicle Test Procedure (WLTP), a new, more realistic test method for measuring fuel consumption and CO2 emissions. Since September 1, 2018, the WLTP has replaced the new European driving cycle (NEDC), the current test procedure. Because of the more realistic test conditions, the fuel consumption and CO2 emission values ​​measured according to the WLTP are in many cases higher than those measured according to the NEDC. It is still mandatory to communicate the NEDC values. ** Optional equipment for a surcharge *** Ford SYNC 3 with AppLink and touchscreen is the logical further development of our communication and entertainment systems. The system can be operated even more intuitively thanks to an expanded voice control and the new, capacitive touchscreen with a 20.3 cm screen diagonal. Information about Android Auto or Apple CarPlay and its availability as well as the functions can be obtained from the respective provider. **** FordPass Connect is a special accessory. The built-in modem is connected when the vehicle is delivered. You can opt for or against sharing certain data. The use of FordPass Connect and the live traffic information is free of charge for 2 years from the first registration of the vehicle. These services can then be extended for a fee if required. The availability of the services depends on the network coverage and may vary depending on the location and weather conditions. For Live Traffic to work, Ford SYNC 3 is required in conjunction with a Ford navigation system in the vehicle. The WiFi hotspot is not provided by Ford. To use the WiFi hotspot, registration with Vodafone Internet in the Car is required and is subject to Vodafone's terms and conditions. After a free trial period, additional fees apply.
