Leasing partner Opening times Monday-Friday8: 00-17: 00 Saturday08: 00-12: 00 About us Detmolder Strasse 342 - the first location in Bielefeld; this is where the company Reifen & Service Radeck KG started in 1974. Service, specialist staff, always up-to-date machinery and the personal commitment of each individual have led to the company not only being able to establish itself but also to grow. In addition to the car business, it was the large number of truck fleets in particular that increasingly showed the original location the limits of the possibilities. Consequently, in 2009 we decided to move to Elpke 61. Since then, our car and van business has mainly taken place in the newly built assembly hall on four modern workplaces. We have taken the dimensions of current trucks into account with a separate assembly site in Bielefeld Heepen - the spatial options are ideal; cramped space conditions during maneuvering are a thing of the past. Our offer is rounded off by the successful use of our mobile press for forklift and industrial tires for years ... in that case, 'on site' is simply better, faster, more efficient. Conclusion: No matter where and what concerns about tires, wheels and vehicles - we look forward to seeing you Philosophy One name, one term - tires and Radeck have been part of Bielefeld for over 40 years. When we founded the company in 1974, we made the motto 'Tires & Service' our motto. Pure merchandise is everywhere - but customer-oriented, competent advice, personal contact and flexible, individual service make the difference. Long-standing, trusting business relationships with a large number of customers are the result of our efforts - and proof that you see it as we do.
