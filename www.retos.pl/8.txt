We aim to establish and maintain long-term cooperation with clients of the transport industry in the field of comprehensive vehicle fleet service. The convenient location of the company at the national road No. 1 Gdańsk - Cieszyn and the proximity of the Czech border made Renault Trucks Polska Sp. z o.o., granted the company in May 1998 concessions for the provision of maintenance services, extended by the sale of this brand's cars in January 1999. In May 1999, pursuant to contracts signed with the Czech manufacturer of semi-trailers and trailers Panav, the Regional Rolling Stock Service Center became the general importer of this brand's products to Poland. The great premiere took place at the Poznań International Motor Show 1999. As an authorized Renault Trucks car service company bought modern service cars. These cars were included in the Renault Serwis 24 system, helping cars damaged on the road around the clock. The scope of these activities includes a towing car, which also provides its services outside our country. Most repairs are carried out in a modern car workshop equipped with 5 repair stations. The company performs all types of repairs, from bodywork, painting and mechanical repairs, to specialized staff. The company's material inventory and constant communication with the main Renault Trucks auto parts warehouse allow repair time to be minimized, ensuring mobility for our customers. The sales department's task is to sell new and used Renault Trucks trucks optimally suited to customer needs. Constant expansion of the scope of activity has led to the creation of a modern two-station roller car washer for cars and trucks. In June 2001, Retos launched a District Vehicle Control Station, which provides technical testing services for all types of passenger, truck and delivery vehicles, including gas installations, buses, motorbikes, mopeds and vehicles transporting hazardous materials. In 2004, the analog tachograph service was launched, which in January 2007 expanded the scope of services to include calibration and calibration of digital tachographs. In 2007, we also launched a tire service in cooperation with Michelin Poland. Thanks to our many years of experience in the use and repair of car transporter bodies, in 2008 Retos was authorized to carry out all repairs of specialist bodies for the transport of passenger cars and trucks of the LOHR brand, and in 2013 we obtained ROLFO authorization. Wishing to provide our clients with comprehensive service not only for trucks but also for trailers and semi-trailers, we obtained in 2014 service authorization for servicing and repairing vehicles of the WIELTON and FLIEGL brands, thanks to which the scope of our services has been significantly expanded. We do not forget about the drivers for whom we have launched a Truck Bar in our company offering travelers and not only the possibility of having a hot meal. In addition, the RETOS service has a separate resting place, where those waiting for repair can take advantage of free WIFI or TV and a vending machine with drinks and coffee. You're welcome.
