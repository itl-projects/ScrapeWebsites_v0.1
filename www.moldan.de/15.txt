For painting your vehicle or for coating other objects, such as furniture, housings or industrial parts, we have an almost infinite range of color and effect patterns ready for you. We would be happy to advise you on the choice of refinish or the individual design of your items. If you have a sample of your favorite color, just bring it to the conversation. Our electronic color measuring device ensures that we can reproduce the desired color as well as possible. In this way, we also succeed in precisely restoring the paintwork of damaged vehicles and thus achieving maximum value retention. Our water-based paints relieve the environment Today, water-based paints are used in automotive OEM painting by all major European manufacturers. In the future, water-thinnable paints will also replace solvent-based paints for refinish paints. We committed ourselves to environmental protection in Erlangen at an early stage. That is why we can already carry out almost any water-based refinish today, which means that much less solvent is released into the air. The waterborne basecoats not only achieve top results in terms of air pollution control, but also in weather resistance and color accuracy. All in all, progress as it should be: environmentally friendly, process-safe and consumer-friendly.
