After a few years, the seals become hard and porous and start to sweat. For this reason, leaks develop in some engines. Engines lose oil and over time they become so oily that you cannot tell where the engine is losing oil, you need an engine wash. Anyone familiar with vehicle construction should know that the fresh air for the air conditioning, heating and for the driver's compartment is drawn in under the hood. That is why the engine wash is also useful for health reasons, otherwise the occupants will breathe in the polluted air that is drawn in by the ventilation system. Why is our engine wash one of the best? Our engine wash is your TÜV success. We have a professional approach to engine washing (see photo series). Several workshops contact us to use our engine wash. The vehicle is taken on stage and carefully processed from below and above with an engine cleaner. After the cleaner has acted on the entire engine compartment is cleaned with the high-pressure cleaner. The engine and engine compartment are then dried with compressed air. Washed out preservatives are restored. Our partners include Aral, Pitstopp, ATU, Mercedes Benz and many more. The price for our professional engine wash is: 55.00 € (plus VAT - this offer refers to the pure engine wash, without dismantling of cladding. Costs for dismantling and assembly of cladding must be inquired!) Appointments are made after telephone registration. You can be sure that we will always adapt to you on time. For those who work a week, there is the possibility to make an extra appointment on Saturday between 9 a.m. and 2 p.m. If you have any further questions, please do not hesitate to contact us by phone.
