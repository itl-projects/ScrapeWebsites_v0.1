Premises This Cookie Policy (hereinafter also "Policy") has the purpose of describing the management methods of the site currently available at seat.fratellisanna.com with reference to the use of Cookies or markers (hereinafter also "Cookies" ). The above site is owned by Volkswagen Group Italia S.p.A. (hereinafter also "VGI"), a company subject to the direction and coordination of Volkswagen AG. Cookies or markers (hereinafter also "Cookies") are packets of information sent by a web server (in this case from this site) to the Internet browser (hereinafter also "Browser") of the user / visitor and from the latter automatically stored on the personal computer or on the mobile device (hereinafter also "Device") used for navigation and automatically sent back to the server at each subsequent access to the site. This site uses cookies, therefore, for a complete use of the service, it is recommended to configure the browser used for navigation in such a way that it accepts the reception of the cookies themselves. Contents 1. General information on the cookies used 2. Cookies used for aggregate analysis of visits to the site 3. Cookies used to publish interest-based advertisements 4. How to disable cookies 5. List of cookies used by the site 1. General information on Used cookies We inform that by default almost all browsers are set to automatically accept cookies. Users / visitors can still change the default configurations at any time. As specified above, disabling or deleting Cookies may however preclude optimal use of some areas / functions of the site or compromise the use of the services offered under authentication. If users / visitors want to decide from time to time whether to accept cookies or not, they can also configure their own browser so that it generates a warning each time a cookie is saved. The cookies used can be of the following type: (1) persistent, that is, which remain stored on the hard disk of the device of the user / visitor until they expire; (2) session, that is, they are not stored permanently on the hard disk of the device of the user / visitor and that are deleted when the browser is closed. Cookies are used to: (a) facilitate navigation within the site and ensure its correct use; (b) facilitate access to services that require authentication (avoiding that users have to re-enter authentication credentials at each access to services); (c) for statistical purposes, to find out which areas of the site have been visited; (d) for optimal management of pages and advertising spaces; (e) to deliver content and advertising in line with the choices made by surfers (so-called behavioral advertising with dynamic creativity). Session cookies are used in order to transmit the identification of browsing sessions to allow safe and efficient exploration of the site. The session cookies used on this site avoid the use of other IT techniques that are potentially detrimental to the confidentiality of user / visitor browsing and are also used to improve the provision of the services offered. In addition, cookies can be specific to the site (used, for example, to find out the number of pages visited within the site) or to third parties (i.e. generated by other sites to provide content on the site visited by users). This site can use anonymous third-party cookies in order to manage the delivery of advertising messages in a dynamic and advanced way. The most popular browsers provide the ability to block only third-party cookies, accepting only those of the site. Furthermore, some companies that generate cookies on third-party sites offer the possibility to deactivate and / or inhibit their own cookies in a simple and immediate way, even when these are anonymous or do not involve the registration of personal identification data such as, for example, addresses. IP. 2. Cookies used for aggregate analysis of visits to the site VGI makes use of aggregate analysis tools of navigation data that allow to improve the sites (Adobe Omniture and Google Analytics). These tools use cookies that are installed on the device of the user / visitor in order to allow the site manager to analyze how users / visitors use the sites themselves. The information generated by the cookies on the use of the sites by the user / visitor (including the anonymized IP address by masking some fields) will be transmitted and stored on the Adobe and Google servers. The aforementioned information may be used for the purpose of tracing and examining the use of the sites by users / visitors, for reporting activities and to provide other services relating to the activities of the sites, as well as for browsing. To fully protect the privacy of users / visitors, VGI uses the "masking IP" functionality, which requires the system to obscure the last 8 digits of the IP address of the user / visitor before any type of processing is performed, effectively making the analyzed data anonymous. In any case, users / visitors will have the opportunity to inhibit the use of Google Analytics and prevent their storage on their Device through the appropriate browser add-on for deactivating Google Analytics, made available by Google at the address https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout. To activate this component that inhibits the system for sending information on the user's / visitor's visit, simply install it by following the instructions on the screen, close and reopen the browser. As regards, however, the cookies relating to Adobe Omniture, users / visitors will have the opportunity to find all the necessary information at the following address: http://www.adobe.com/it/privacy/analytics.html. 3. Cookies used to publish interest-based ads The sites may use third-party cookies to publish advertisements defined according to the interests of users / visitors. This information is collected while the user / visitor is browsing and is in no way connected to the account with which the latter accesses the sites. In particular, Google Adwords of Google Inc. uses navigation data within its online advertising circuit to offer advertisements more relevant to the interests of the user / visitor expressed during the browsing sessions. VGI uses the aforementioned technology and uses navigation data within its own sites to offer targeted and interest-based advertising to the user / visitor. More generally, each browser allows the user / visitor to disable third-party cookies aimed at allowing advertising based on the interests expressed by the latter. For example, in the case of the Firefox browser, the deactivation of the cookies in question can be carried out by following the instructions on the "Cookie Management" page of Firefox. In the case of Internet Explorer, on the other hand, instructions on how to disable third-party cookies are given at the following link: "Management of Internet Explorer cookies". 4. How to disable cookies Most browsers are initially configured to automatically accept cookies. The user / visitor can modify these configurations in order to inhibit cookies or to warn that cookies are used on their device. There are various possibilities for managing cookies and, in this regard, the user / visitor can refer to the instruction manual or to the help screen of his browser to find out how to configure or change the settings on cookies. In case of use of different devices (e.g. personal computers, smartphones, tablets, etc.), the user / visitor must ensure that each browser on each device used is configured in such a way as to reflect its preferences regarding use of Cookies. 5.
