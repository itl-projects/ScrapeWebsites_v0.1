Laseur on Honda Welman Reason to visit: Chris Groen comes to your house on behalf of the company. Are you looking for a company without bureaucracy, but with a go-getter mentality? You have come to the right place! There are no shorter lines between the director and his team. You send a WhatsApp to Jack Welman. Before you can further explain the situation, you will be called home by Jeroen Hoffman. The result: Chris Green arrives at your home, checks your battery, determines that it is "empty", install a new battery and it is gone. Expertise, effectiveness and fast service characterize this company. , that many Hondas, new and used, of this company have already owned and are still in the possession of four members of our family. I recommend this company to anyone who wants to hear and read it. How can we help you?
