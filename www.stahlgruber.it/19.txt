Course news NEW ++ NEW ++ NEW Exercise authorization according to § 7a HWO for master craftsmen Contact STAHLGRUBER Otto Gruber AG, based in Poing, has been working for two important branches of the German economy and handicraft for decades: the motor vehicle and rubber sectors. Both areas require well-trained and experienced craftsmen who ensure that the right material is used and installed correctly. The focus is on the safety of people and their health, as well as the maximum usage time for installed, exchanged or repaired materials. The craftsman who provides these services has a high responsibility. For this reason, it is imperative that he is not only well trained, but also that his knowledge and skills are constantly optimized and adapted to the new developments. and to maintain and intensify the high level of vulcanization craft. The training courses are largely streamlined on a topic-specific basis and if possible "on site", i.e. performed near the course participants.
