zassels custom bikes / zcb.:. Contact .:. Home Bikes4Sale Products Gallery Showroom Contact Imprint Privacy Policy Team The company was founded in June 1984 by Volker "Zassel" Schloß and since then it has been important to be regarded as a registered car workshop. Repairs and tuning on the motorcycles are only carried out under the supervision of the workshop master. Since the mid-1980s, the team around company boss "Zassel" has been focusing on individual customer requests. Customers, mostly Harley drivers or Harley enthusiasts, are at home in all walks of life. From the factory worker to the university professor, all customers are treated equally and satisfied without compromise. Complete motorcycle conversions, engine and transmission overhauls with warranty or engine tuning have become the order of the day. Exclusive wide tire conversions with metal products from our own production are also carried out for customers. In addition to its own product line, Zassel's has spare parts and accessories from all well-known manufacturers. From A for Arlen Ness to Z for Zodiac, everything is available and can be shipped daily on request. The shipping of parts is becoming increasingly important, especially through its own product line "ZCB".
