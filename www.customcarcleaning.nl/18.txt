The real detail at a professional level was therefore a logical consequence of two very great passions in his life: cars and that drive for perfection! Since the end of 2007, these two concepts form the foundation of an own company: Custom Car Cleaning. Custom Car Cleaning is specialized in detailing cars. We focus entirely on the high and exclusive segment. Heavy demands are made in this segment in terms of quality and service and that is exactly what we offer. Custom Car Cleaning focuses on specialist work such as performing paint corrections and offering high-quality paint protection. This type of work takes more time and requires a higher degree of professionalism, making it a bit more expensive than traditional "brushing". In addition, we tackle the problems immediately by actually removing them (as good as possible), and not just covering them up temporarily with camouflage products. The condition of the paintwork, the wheels and the interior ultimately determine the value of your car. It is often absurd to spend a higher amount on a car detail, but on the other hand, this is often only a fraction of the purchase value. And this to give your precious property, which often costs as much as a small house, the care it deserves and to bring it back and keep it in optimal condition.
