Unfortunately, that was a little bit the case for the visit to us. Optically in terms of paint, because technically this is really one of the better. However, the gray look of the paint suggested otherwise and that had to change. With this short photo report, we show what is still possible with a professional correction and detail. In any case, this Porsche has improved by leaps and bounds. Are you also interested in such a metamorphosis for your own precious possession? Feel free to contact us to discuss the possibilities together. Thanks for your attention, Greetings Bart Custom Car Cleaning + 316 - 55 82 72 89 Polishing mistakes from the past remain visible in the present. We see crazy flames, clouds, markings and simply not a nice direct reflection. In the workshop, after extensive cleaning with clay, etc., we will assess the paint under artificial light. We do this on 4300K, 6000K and 6500K with a diversity of lumens. Under warm light you often see very different things as only under daylight / cold light. This is how the paint stands for our paint correction. In the workshop, after extensive cleaning with clay, etc., we will assess the paint under artificial light.

This is how the paint stands for our paint correction. The next after pictures are only after the rough steps and a medium refinement. We have to wash the car again after this and in two very fine steps after polishing, but the idea is already clear. We see a sleek smooth paint with a beautiful reflection. Due to that sharp reflection, the metallic in the paint also comes into its own much better. Once fully detailed, it was time to evaluate the car in the sun. Needless to say how beautifully the car has been refurbished. The delicate paintwork is now protected with two layers of Swissvax Concorso Wax for a wonderful preservation. «Overview Custom Car CleaningHeerenstraat 2, 6114 RN Susteren + 31 (0) 6 - 55 82 72 89info@customcarcleaning.nl KVK: (NL) 14.103.658 VAT: (NL) 001.836.698.B46IBAN: NL38RABO0126339058 FacebookYouTubeInstagram © 2008 - 2020 Custom Car Cleaning DisclaimerPrivacyContact Custom Car Cleaning is powered by GraphX ​​CMS HomeWebshopMethodsOfferF.AQReportsGalleryAbout UsContact € 0.00 0
