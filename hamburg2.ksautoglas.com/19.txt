Information about car glass: EXCHANGE OR REPAIR? STONE BLOCK REPAIR AUTOGLAS - EXCHANGE INSURANCE PROTECTION REPLACEMENT OR REPAIR? In principle, it is only possible to determine whether the repair is possible or whether the pane needs to be replaced after the pane has been inspected! It can be said in advance: a cracked pane may only be replaced! You can see from the following indications whether a repair is possible: if the stone chip is smaller than a 2 euro coin if the stone chip is not in the field of vision (an approx. 30 cm wide area above the steering wheel) if the stone chip is more than 10 cm Stone chip repair is removed from the edge of the pane Repairing a stone chip means more than just a cosmetic effect. The repair restores the stability and thus an important function of the windscreen. Often, the damaged area can hardly be seen after the repair, depending on the age, size and nature of the stone chips. At KS, we use the latest repair methods and one of the best and highest quality resins available on the German market. That is why we offer a 10-year guarantee on our repairs! The best thing is that most insurance companies will reimburse the cost even if you have agreed a deductible for glass damage. AUTO GLASS - EXCHANGE If the windscreen cannot be repaired, it must be replaced! Modern windows are glued and are often flush with the body with very narrow gaps. KS guarantees with special cutting processes, for example with a highly tear-resistant nylon thread, that the windscreen can be removed without damaging the paint or interior panels! Our partner companies only use discs from the original manufacturers such as Sekurit or Pilkington. Even the most modern panes equipped with driver assistance systems are no problem for the KS professionals! And as a rule, the required lens is available on site within 24 hours! INSURANCE PROTECTION Glass damage is always covered by comprehensive insurance (also within comprehensive insurance, which usually has a higher deductible). Important: There is no damage-free discount in the partial coverage! This means that they are not "upgraded" in the event of a claim! You pay a maximum of the agreed excess for the glass damage; stone chip repairs are generally free of charge. KS AUTOGLAS cooperates with almost all insurance companies. For you, this means that we take care of the entire claims processing directly with the insurance centers. No writing, no racing - we'll do it for you!
