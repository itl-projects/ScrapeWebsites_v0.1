Chapeau! It doesn't get any better :-) 5 points from s.ch.k16 09.02.2020 The appointment was uncomplicated and the repair was very good and affordable. I had an approximately 8-10 cm dent in the tailgate, of which nothing is now visible. Excellent! 5 points from zabel.db 10/22/2019 TOP! Had ugly hail damage, now you can see nothing of it.

Thank you again. 5 points from sydkerf3 May 15th, 2017 I had my first bump after 14 years of driving the front left code wing of my Corsa. Called, made an appointment and within days there was nothing to see - just great! Also the price-performance ratio was great! Also a super nice dent doctor. I will gladly come again. 5 points from wolfgacb 14.04.2017 Very good work, fast and in great quality. 5 points from grabow22 04/07/2017 My dents were in unfavorable places. I had previously visited another “dent expert” who pointed out to me that it was impossible to get the dents away. After MANY recommendations for Lars Laux, I decided to visit him and the dents were gone quickly !!!! On the whole: fast, excellent, inexpensive work. I would recommend Lars Laux anytime! Thanks again ! 5 points from eugen.95 09.08.2016 The damage was in an unfavorable place and could unfortunately only be repaired to 99%. Nevertheless, I am satisfied with the work and the result and like to give the full 5 stars! A huge stone fell from my heart after the work was done.
