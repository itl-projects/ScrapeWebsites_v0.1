WASPANNE - Mertinke-BMW Motorcycles Frankfurt START ABOUT INACTIVELY NEW ONLINE SHOPMOTOR WHEELSTERMINETUNINGSPANNETOURENFAHRTKONTAKTIMPRINT BMW teams have a long tradition with us. From 1953-1970 our father Walter Mertinke celebrated great successes at home and abroad. His experiences and records passed on to us are still used today to look after our customers' BMW teams. Important note: Due to the increasingly full schedule on the one hand and the increasingly poor condition of the teams that come to us for the first time, on the other hand, we now only take care of the teams delivered by us or our existing customers!
