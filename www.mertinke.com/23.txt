We have been optimizing BMW motorcycles since the company was founded. The highest level of experience and precision is required for this work. We don't have to take half the motorcycle apart. With the new boxers with four-valve engine and all K models up to the 1600GTL, an inspection with our partly self-developed diagnostic and setting devices often has a noticeably positive effect on power delivery and fuel consumption. But we also don't forget our friends of the classic two-valve boxers. 1070 cc are now at least hip, 80 PS and 92 Nm but only a basis for further increases in power and torque. 1998 R 1100 GS MERTINKE STREET "Supermoto" without beak with BMW wheel set and TÃœV model certificate 2000 R 1150 GS MERTINKE STREET what the 1100er can do ..... R 80 Classic The R 80 with mono-wheel chassis here is very classic with spoke wheels, R 90S Cockpit fairing and the window we developed in 1974. The windscreen and driving behavior have been noticeably improved thanks to the higher and longer rear window. And the best, it is (still) available! MAGNI-BMW 1986 it was a special challenge for us to further refine this probably unique motorcycle right down to the tips of our hair R 100 Motorsport With a raised engine, frame-fixed S paneling, K100 telescopic fork, box swingarm with wide tires, the Battle of Twins The national motorcycle sport event in the eighties required completely rebuilt "two-valve", nothing remained original! K 100 MERTINKE-MOTORSPORT The first optimization of a K-model took place in our house in 1986. Pistons of the K75 and a new tuning were sufficient for 102 HP. Light PVM rims and a carefully tuned Wilbers chassis made for an overall excellent motorcycle of its time.
