To your advantage, we as BMW enthusiasts in Frankfurt have only looked after BMW motorcycles for more than 60 years, because compared to a BMW car, the maintenance and repair of a BMW motorcycle is about as different as motorcycle and car driving itself. Behind the name Mertinke has a well-established team of experienced BMW specialists in Frankfurt who complement each other in an ideal way. The experience that you have gained with your own BMW motorcycles on test rides all over Europe continuously flows into your vehicle. BMW drivers have not only come to us from Frankfurt and the Rhine-Main region since 1953. Motorcyclists from all over Europe, even from Japan, find their way to Frankfurt-Heddernheim via the AB junction of the same name on the A 661. BMW motorcycles and everything that goes with it are our calling, not just our job!
