With natural materials such as tree trunks and natural rocks, a very special play paradise for children is to be created in Käthe-Kollwitz-Straße by summer, because everything is under the motto "detectives". In addition to earthworks, fence construction and the production of paths and squares, the colleagues also take care of planting the playground including lawn seeds.
