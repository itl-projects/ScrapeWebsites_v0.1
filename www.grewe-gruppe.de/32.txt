All the better if you can combine surfing the Internet with a good deed. We at grewe have been using Ecosia as a pre-installed standard search engine for some time. Our employees also help the climate, because the green search engine donates around 80 percent of its income from ads to tree planting projects around the world. According to Ecosia, around 45 searches are enough to plant a new tree. The Berlin-based company has already planted more than 90 million trees worldwide.
