Only 3 liters of water is used and with the efficient steam washing, the car's varnish is cleaned from the wear that brush washing brings. At the same time, the need for chemical cleaners is significantly reduced, but if necessary we recommend extra treatment for asphalt and tar on the outside of the car. This is always included in our Lilla Rekond but is added for Exterior car wash. Even inside the car, steam washing is very effective. In an Internal Recond, the panels and AC are sterilized with dry steam. An effective way of removing particles and pollen, with the advantage that a steam-washed interior stays clean and fresh for longer. For example, engine wash, rims, seats and vinyl surfaces we use SONAX car care products. SONAX is environmentally certified according to ISO 14001, with phosphate-free and dermatologically tested products in the range. Treat yourself to everyday luxury and leave the car at the spa with us! Keeping the car in good condition prevents wear and tear and depreciation. Environment We clean your car with steam, without unnecessary chemicals. Steam washing is effective and significantly reduces the need for chemical cleaners. Only 3 liters of water are needed for external steam washing. Compare that to about 200 liters for a car wash. This is why we choose steam washing - a sustainable method that minimizes both water consumption and emissions in nature.
