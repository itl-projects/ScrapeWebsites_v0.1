Initially, Arco-Trailer was limited to the manufacture of boat trailers, especially made to measure. Since 1992, Arco-Trailer has taken over the agency and distribution warehouse for the Knott company - axles and brakes. In 1994 the company had to move from Berlin to Gallun near Mittenwalde due to the lack of space. As a result, the warehouse was expanded and the range expanded. We have been dealers in Carado motorhomes and caravans since 2011. Facts and data The manufacturing program includes e.g. Currently trailer from 350 kg total weight unbraked to 3500 kg total weight braked as well as winter trestles, hand-trolley, spare parts and boat trailer accessories, u. a. Winches, keel rolls, long runs, crank supports etc. We also manufacture the boat trailer according to your specifications and equipment requirements. Custom made to measure, e.g. B. rowing boat or canoe trailer, we manufacture on request and according to the offer.
