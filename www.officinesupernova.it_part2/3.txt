OUR SERVICES AT YOUR SERVICE THE CUTTING SERVICE The network of Supernova / Oncar by Supernova workshops offers professional operators and competent service through competent operators, through both ordinary and extraordinary maintenance. Among these services and of course including the car coupon. Show more As required by Regulation (EU) no. 461/2010 (former Monti Decree) in order to take advantage of the warranty of your vehicle, there is no longer the obligation to make coupons and ordinary repairs at an official dealer of the manufacturer. For motorists this translates into a wider choice in terms of assistance and spare parts. All the check coupons provided for in the maintenance booklet (including the first one, about which many motorists are still convinced that they must go to the dealer) can therefore also be performed at independent repair shops. The Supernova / Oncar by Supernova workshops, in fact, are equipped to perform maintenance coupons, as provided by the car manufacturers, even during the period in which the car is covered by the warranty without losing its validity! Our operators, in addition to releasing the necessary documentation to certify the conformity of the interventions and checks carried out, only use spare parts of equivalent quality to the original!
