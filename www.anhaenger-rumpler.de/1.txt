The new Böckmann professional trailer care is an individually manufactured surface care with water and dirt repellent properties. It brings an excellent color refreshment and a silky matt shine to bleached wood and plastic surfaces. Tire flanks and rubber seals are protected against embrittlement. This polish is also very easy to use. A thorough pre-cleaning with a cold cleaner is all that is required. Then the polish is applied evenly to the surface with a sponge or cloth. For heavily bleached parts, the polish should be applied with a rough sponge. The gloss effect can be enhanced by simply polishing. We recommend treating the trailer with the professional trailer care every six months. The content of one container is 1000 ml, which is sufficient for a double application in a horse transporter.
