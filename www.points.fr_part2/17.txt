Air conditioning Reception - Air conditioning Repair and maintenance of air conditioning: the Point Service Indispensable in summer, air conditioning is a comfort device that allows you to enjoy a cool and homogeneous temperature in your cabin. To preserve the circuit of your vehicle, it is recommended to operate your air conditioning at least 15 minutes per month, including in winter.
