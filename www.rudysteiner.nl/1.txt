What to do What to do in case of damage? Step 1 / In case of personal injury or substantial material damage: call the police and (possibly) an ambulance. Take any pictures at the scene of the accident and mark the location of the damaged vehicles. In the event of minor material damage and if the parties involved agree on the facts, the police need not be called in. At all times, make sure that the damage form is correctly and completely completed and signed by both parties. Step 2 / Are there any witnesses? Inquire and write down the name and address, or make a note of the witness's car registration number if you have been unable to speak to the person concerned. Because if there are several readings of a collision, witnesses can have a decisive voice. Step 3 / Are you unable to continue driving? Then a towing service must be called in. Your green card almost always contains the telephone number of an emergency call center for your insurance. The emergency center ensures that a towing company takes your car away and is delivered to Steiner Autoschade. The recovery company charges the costs to the emergency center, who then ensures that the costs are declared to your insurer.
