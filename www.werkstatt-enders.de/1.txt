If the date for the main inspection falls outside of the season, it must be carried out in the first month of recommissioning. Attachments and exhaust / noise behavior. We eliminate existing defects on your motorcycle so that you do not fall into the inspection trap. If possible, do not exceed the date for the main inspection! A traffic control would otherwise result in fines of up to EUR 60 and a point in Flensburg exceeding 8 months. In the event of an accident with an expired inspection sticker, the insurance coverage does not necessarily expire. Most insurers, however, see this as slight negligence and you can take recourse as an insured person. This means that you would have to pay part of the damage to your motorcycle out of your own pocket. And that is significantly more than the price of a tank of fuel.
