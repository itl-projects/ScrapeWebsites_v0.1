Unfortunately, this also applies to motorcycle accidents. If it has crashed, the motorcycle should be examined in its entirety. If chassis components have been damaged, a frame measurement must show how big the damage is. If certain structures move outside the permissible tolerances, this can often not be reliably recognized without technical support. The result is restless driving behavior and poor driving safety. Even if you are considering selling your motorcycle later, an electronic frame measurement is recommended.
