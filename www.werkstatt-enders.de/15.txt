However, you can and should check the air pressure, tread depth and age of your motorcycle tires. Air pressure: Every two weeks or before every big ride. Better to use 0.2 bar pressure than too little. Observe the recommendations of the tire manufacturers for the respective motorcycle type. Tread depth: At least 1.6 mm, better 2 mm. You can recognize the age of the tires by the 4-digit DOT number vulcanized into the side wall of the tire (production week and year). Pay attention to air pressure and profile depth yourself. We take care of everything else at the tire service for motorcycles! Only those skilled in the art will recognize the actual wear and tear of a tire and hidden defects such as imbalance due to brake and highway plates or ozone cracks due to prolonged intense sunlight. Recognized and eliminated in good time will increase the lifespan of your motorcycle's tires and avoid an expensive tire change early on. Even with the best service, a tire change is necessary one day. We take over ordering, balancing and assembly as well as the disposal of your old tires. Feel free to contact us!
