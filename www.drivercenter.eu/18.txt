WHAT IS THE TIRES TYPE-APPROVAL The type-approval is the official recognition by the Authority, or the competent body, of the conformity of an object to a specific technique or regulation. The European Directives issued during the 90s oblige the homologation of vehicles and their components (including tires). The tires must meet a series of regulations that establish their dimensional and performance characteristics (loads, speeds ...) and the relative markings. APPROVED TIRE MARKING All tires intended for motor vehicles, mopeds, motorcycles, commercial and heavy vehicles, caravans, etc. to be able to circulate they must be homologated. An homologated tire has, on one of the two sidewalls, a marking consisting of a capital letter "E" in a circle or a small letter "e" in a rectangle or both, followed by a number. This marking, always in relief, must necessarily be followed by a number generally consisting of six / seven digits. The tires are also subject to production conformity checks to ensure that the product always ensures the same level of performance. Only the products " compliant "can be sold, purchased and placed on the market. Sign up for the newsletter Stay up to date with news and promotions!
