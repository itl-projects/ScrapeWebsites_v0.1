Defective shock absorbers are an incalculable safety risk and can cause expensive consequential damage. If the shock absorbers are defective, the braking distance becomes longer and the steering behavior becomes uncontrollable. The risk of aquaplaning increases and your tires wear out unevenly. Defective shock absorbers also impair the function of ABS (anti-lock braking system) and ESP (electronic stability program). Shock absorbers should therefore be checked regularly every 20,000 kilometers. Make an appointment with us today!
