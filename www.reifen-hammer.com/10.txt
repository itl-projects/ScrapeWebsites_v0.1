The independent tire professionals with competent advice, reliable car repairs and comprehensive service! 1948 Willy Hammer founds a vulcanizing workshop in Radebeul Alt-Kötzschenbroda 39 with only one employee. Willy Hammer works very hard and invests in machines and tools. He creates a large customer base through satisfied customers. 1973 His son Hans-Jürgen Hammer took over the company. He transformed the company from repair service to "service and retreading operation". Only with a wealth of ideas and the ability to improvise did he manage to do justice to the customers.

However, he received active support from the workforce and family members. 1991 Renaming of the "Willy Hammer" company to "Reifen Hammer" 1993 Foundation of "Reifen Hammer GmbH" 1994 Reconstruction of the company building and modernization of the machines to the latest state.
