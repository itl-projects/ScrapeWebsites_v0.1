Because with the increase in the internal temperature in the vehicle, the risk of accidents increases. The driver's concentration and reaction time decrease. An optimally set air conditioning system therefore not only keeps you cool, but also ensures your safety. Why air conditioning service? Air conditioning systems are not hermetically sealed systems. Refrigerant can escape and moisture can penetrate. On the one hand, this leads to a loss of performance or even system failure, and on the other hand to high repair costs in the event of damage to the components. Air conditioning system maintenance: pressure test draining and drying the system leak test filling with refrigerant and oil according to the manufacturer's specifications (with refrigerant R134a) functional test visual inspection drive belt air conditioning system disinfection With every air conditioning system, harmful spores, fungi and bacteria can build up on the evaporator, which can be conducted into the vehicle interior with air (mold odor ). Regular disinfection makes them harmless and only healthy, fresh air gets into your car. Make an appointment with us today!
