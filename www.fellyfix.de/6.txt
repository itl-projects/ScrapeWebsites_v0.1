Fellyfix â€¢ Smart Repair Center Hamburg Fellyfix dent removal is the most cost-effective way to remove dents from your vehicle body. Where previously you had to paint due to a dent, today the dent is massaged out of the sheet metal using special tools. Adhesive technology is also possible in poorly accessible areas so that almost all dents can be removed. Even hail or chestnut damage is no problem for us.
