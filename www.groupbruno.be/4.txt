About us | Group Bruno About us FAQ Vacancies Terms and Conditions Privacy statement Home Services Branches Partner network Team Contact Bruno card network Find a branch About us About us It all started on April 28, 1988 when Giuliano and Angelo Bruno started a petrol station on the Hasseltweg in Genk. The other brothers and sister had the same ambition and soon the name Bruno became an established name in the business world. In the meantime, there is a large network of manned service stations spread all over Belgian Limburg. Building on the success of Bruno Service Stations, we have also developed and optimized other activities, such as Bruno's Foodcorner, Bruno Carwash, Bruno Car Rental and Bruno Safe Parking. All these activities are centrally coordinated by Group Bruno from the head office in Genk. Since 2006, all Bruno branches have been independently operated by franchisees. Managing and maintaining the concepts is now one of the tasks of the founders of Group Bruno.
