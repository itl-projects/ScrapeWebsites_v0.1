When Robert Liebens founded the company in 1936, smooth service, quality and craftsmanship were central. This is still the case today. Times change, our craftsmanship does not. Today Body Liebens has grown into a modern business that continues to grow every day to the rhythm of satisfied customers and new technologies. A reference in the sector, synonymous with craftsmanship. It is no coincidence that we were awarded the Eurogarant quality label. Nor should we count several leasing and insurance companies among our customers. Service as a common thread Because service is an important pillar for us, we try to do everything possible for our customers - even more than that. For example, we personally collect damaged vehicles and return them fully cleaned (inside and outside) after repairs. Moreover, Body Liebens offers additional benefits for fleet owners and economical hoist prices. Discover further on this site what Body Liebens can also do for you. Environment Bodywork Liebens only works with water-based paints. Much better for the environment, because this way we avoid the use of heavy chemicals.
