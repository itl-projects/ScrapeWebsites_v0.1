The following are a few examples: Park dents Hail damage Storm damage (e.g. caused by fallen branches) Minor damage Other dents With lease returns, even small dents often involve large amounts because our methods are not taken into account. In order to avoid any nasty surprises, it's best to have the dents removed beforehand. For an accurate assessment, it is best to make an appointment with us or send us a photo in advance. > Contact <How long does the repair take? It always depends on the size and number of dents. A small dent can be removed within an hour and large hail damage can generally be removed in 2-3 days. Appointments can usually be made within 3 working days at the latest. We can help more flexibly in emergencies. Does the insurance cover the costs? All costs caused by hail or storm are fully covered if you have a full or partial cover. You will then only have to pay any excess costs.
