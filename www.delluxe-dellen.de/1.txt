This mainly consists of bent rods of different lengths. We also use special lamps so that we can remove the dents with millimeter precision. We use 2 methods. 1) Pressing is used much more often because it can be used to reach almost any part of the car. The dents are then gently pressed out from the inside using the professional tools. 2) Drag This method is used when the dents are in hard-to-reach or inaccessible places.
