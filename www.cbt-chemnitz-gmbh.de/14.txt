CATALYST AND PARTICLE FILTER, MORE THAN JUST A SILENCER A modern exhaust system hardly has anything in common with the simple exhaust of earlier days. To protect the environment, catalysts and particle filters filter the pollutants and electronic systems regulate the emissions of the car.

WELL-EQUIPPED FOR EVERY CASE If the rear muffler on your vehicle is to be replaced or a particle filter is to be retrofitted, we trust the quality of strong manufacturer brands in our auto repair shop, e.g. Walker, Eberspächer or HJS. PARTICLE FILTER PERSONALLY EXPLAINED Many cities have set up environmental zones that you, as a diesel driver, may only drive with a green sticker to comply with the emission limit values. Otherwise there is a fine. We would be happy to advise you in our auto repair shop whether it is also possible to retrofit your vehicle with a suitable particle filter and what options there are for state funding. © 2020 CBT Chemnitzer Bau-und Fahrzeugtechnik GmbH | All rights reserved.
