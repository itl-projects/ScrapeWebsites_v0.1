This is particularly ensured by components such as shock absorbers, springs and steering parts. Your AUTOFIT workshop CBT in 09117 Chemnitz uses a chassis test to determine wear and make you an individual offer for your vehicle. CHECK SHOCK ABSORBER Shock absorbers are used to reduce and brake the vibrations of your vehicle's vehicle spring. However, they are subject to creeping wear and tear, the driver usually gets used to the deterioration in the driving behavior of his car. Have the shock absorbers of your car checked every 20,000 km in your AUTOFIT workshop CBT in 09117 Chemnitz during a shock absorber check. HIGHEST SAFETY WITH STRONG BRANDS With shock absorbers e.g. from SACHS or MONROE, you are on the safe side when it comes to quality in our garage. The technical properties are tailored to the specifications of the vehicle manufacturer and optimally tailored to the chassis structure of your vehicle. For maximum security and best comfort. SHOCK ABSORBER PERSONALLY EXPLAINED A new shock absorber always performs better than an older one, and with different power levels on the left and right, the chassis may behave unstably. That is why we always replace the shock absorbers in pairs in our car workshop for each axle. © 2020 CBT Chemnitzer Bau-und Fahrzeugtechnik GmbH | All rights reserved.
