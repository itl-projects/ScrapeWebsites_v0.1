CLEANING AND DISINFECTION Bacteria, fungi and microorganisms settle on the evaporator of the air conditioning system and thus cause unpleasant smells in the car. A targeted and effective disinfection in our car workshop with specially developed products remedies the problem and provides fresh air. Regular replacement of the cabin filter is recommended - especially for allergy sufferers. AIR CONDITIONING PERSONALLY EXPLAINED Don't just trust a working air conditioning system in summer!
