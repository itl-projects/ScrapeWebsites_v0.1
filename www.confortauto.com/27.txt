A tire is a product made of many materials that is generated as a result of a complex assembly process. Some of these materials are rubber (natural and synthetic), steel, textile fibers, etc. Although the exterior appearance may give us the feeling that it is a simple product - round, black and hollow - in reality it is a highly technological, complex and sophisticated product, the result of numerous research and investments in R&D (research and developing). Tread and tread The tread is the only point of contact between the tire and the vehicle with the road. It must resist wear and abrasion, and be adherent to all types of floors. Also, for lower fuel consumption, it is important that the rolling resistance is low. The tread pattern changes depending on the nature, use (snow tires, for example) and the brand of the tire. Its design can be symmetrical, asymmetric and / or directional, giving the tires a different use. The wear indicator of the drawing is the depth of one of the main grooves (must be 1.6 mm). Be sure to check your tire pressure and wear indicator regularly. A good tire is a tire in good condition and with correct inflation pressure. Your safety and that of your passengers depend on it! Sidewalls The sidewalls, made of flexible rubber, are the lateral area of ​​the tire, and the one that supports more pressure and undergoes more deformations during rolling. Its main function is to absorb and withstand shocks, especially against sidewalks. In addition, on the sidewalls is all the information and markings on the tire. Rims The rims are made up of several metal straps that reinforce the bead of the tire, a part that allows the tire to be secured to the rim. Housing The housing is composed of textile fiber cables forming arcs that go from side to side, and glued to the rubber. It is highly resistant to pressure, and a key element in the structure of the tire. Most passenger car tires have one or two carcasses. Belt with canvas The belt is made up of several layers of steel and a nylon strap that intersect to form a deformable mesh, which is both flexible and rigid. The function of the belt is to give stability to the tread, improving wear, handling and traction. Inner rubber liner The inner liner is a rubber sheet that makes the casing liner and makes it waterproof. This makes it an inner tube for those tubeless tires. Despite its stiffness, the air comes out naturally, so you have to check the pressure once a month and always before a long trip. Its duties? Tires have more features for the driver than you might think. It is not only the contact with the road and what makes us roll, but if we know them a little more closely, we will realize to what extent they can influence driving. Some of these functions are: Guiding the vehicle or steering it As the tire is our contact with the ground (both on asphalt and on the most difficult roads) it helps us to guide the direction of the vehicle. Therefore it is important to monitor the pressure, since if it is lower or higher than the recommended one, it will affect the grip and, therefore, the response to the steering wheel. Attention! : We can lose direction control if there is too much water on the ground (aquaplaning) or if there is gravel. In addition, if we find a curve or we have to make a sharp turn due to an obstacle, we should bring the correct pressure so that the vehicle responds as soon as possible. Supporting the load The tire supports the entire weight of the vehicle, its occupants and the load. In addition to this, when we reach certain speeds and turn in a curve, the inertia of the load causes the weight to be supported to multiply. The weight is also multiplied in braking and acceleration, where the tire suffers a lot and heats up. Thus, a car tire supports 50 times its weight. Attention! : In the vehicle data sheet there are different inflation recommendations depending on the vehicle load, and sometimes depending on the axle. The recommended pressure is related to the vehicle, its weight and power, among other things. Damping In addition to the shock absorbers that reduce the impact of potholes, slopes and obstacles on the road, the tires play a damping role. Pressure is once again the key in this sense in order to make driving more comfortable for the user and also as protection for the vehicle. Attention! : Having the shock absorbers in poor condition and having bad tire pressure can mean that other parts of the vehicle are damaged and damaged. If we take care of these aspects, we will keep our vehicle in good condition for longer. Rolling The fact that the tire rolls on the ground and has to be deformed and adapted to it causes it to heat up and consume energy. A different rolling resistance between one tire and another can jeopardize the comfort of the duct and the occupants of the vehicle. Attention! : In the event that the driver perceives vibrations in the steering wheel, it is necessary to go to the workshop, since it is most likely that a steering alignment will be required. Last The time that we keep the tires in good condition and with all their benefits, will depend on the type of driving we do, the tire pressure, the balance and alignment of the vehicle, the load, the type of roads on which we circulate , etc. There are models of tires that adapt better to some factors than to others, and for this reason it is important that we look at the measurements, but also at the performance and what each model offers us. Attention! : Keep in mind that wear is not the same on the front and rear axles. This will depend on which is the drive axle of the vehicle. Our tire manufacturers recommend crossing the tires at approximately 15,000 km, although it will depend on many factors. This will help us take advantage of the performance of the tire for much longer.
