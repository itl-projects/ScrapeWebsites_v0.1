ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ ABE ABE means general operating license and applies to a vehicle model or an accessory. Attention: If you do not use approved wheels or tires, the entire vehicle registration will expire with the operating license - including insurance protection! The abrasion pattern The abrasion pattern of a tire provides the expert with valuable information on non-optimal settings or possible damage to the chassis (axle geometry, shock absorber defect, etc.). Therefore, you should have your tires checked regularly by a specialist company (approx. Every 10,000 -15,000 km). ABS ABS, the anti-lock braking system, prevents the wheels from locking when braking hard. Advantage: The car remains steerable! In the case of dry, damp and wet roads, the braking distance is usually the same or shorter than that of the same vehicle without ABS. The ABS braking distance may be reduced to fresh snow or gravel. be slightly longer. Attention: In an emergency, press the brake pedal "hard", you should not be confused by the pulsation of the pedal. The axle position The axle position shows the specialist where exactly a tire was used. This is important because a tire has to transmit completely different forces on the steering axle than on the drive axle. Of course, the type of drive must also be taken into account. Regardless of the type of drive, however, the following applies: The better tires belong on the rear axle (see also "Changing the wheels")! Agricultural tractors Productivity in agriculture is also a question of the right tires. With us you get the latest farm tractor tires from well-known manufacturers that are well suited to the diverse requirements of field work and impress with their performance and durability. Soil protection, traction and economy are no strangers to us, but when we talk about agricultural tires, we are not only talking about excellent performance, but also good service and of course a fair price. So that these three components come together, come to us! Airpumping Airpumping is the technical term for what happens when the tire rolls off. The vehicle weight presses the tire onto the road with great pressure, so that the air flows out of the tread channels at high speed when rolling. Whistling and hissing noises occur at high speed, but these can be reduced by cleverly varying the profile arrangement. Alpin Alpin is the name for Michelin tires with a particularly effective "winter bite". They were specially developed for use in snowy areas. The highlight is the patented slat technology: Y-slats (see there) for the Alpine (T up to 190 km / h) and Z-slats (see there) of the Pilot Alpin (H up to 210 km / h). These slats ensure excellent grip on snow and slippery roads. As soon as an Alpin has left 1/3, the number of effective slats doubles and the winter bite increases again. The Z-slat of the Pilot Alpin produces a "support effect", thus ensuring excellent power transmission and Safe driving behavior, especially at high speeds. Further new developments: the BDS slat (for the new Alpin in T and new Pilot Alpin in H) and the VTS slat for high-performance winter tires (for the new Pilot Alpin in V). They combine several advantages: extreme grip on snow and ice, optimal braking and acceleration behavior, excellent handling on dry and wet roads. Aging Aging rubber is a natural process, during which elasticity and adhesion change slightly. This process is very slow and can be further delayed by special anti-aging agents in the tire. Nevertheless one should e.g. do not drive a spare tire that has been left unused in the trunk for more than 6 years with completely new tires! Aquaplaning Aquaplaning is called the floating of the tire on a layer of water. This effect occurs depending on speed, water height, profile depth and structure, air pressure and wheel load. The vehicle can then no longer transmit steering or braking forces. Note: With aquaplaning, leave the steering wheel in the same position and only countersteer slightly when drifting sideways! ASR ASR is the abbreviation for traction control system, an electronic control that ensures that only as much engine power is transferred to the drive wheels when accelerating as they can handle. This prevents the wheels from spinning on slippery roads. Balancing Balancing - this is how the balancing of static or dynamic unbalances on the wheel-tire system is called, which are caused by uneven mass distribution and cause vibrations. Balancing is essential to avoid uneven tire wear and damage to the wheel suspension and to ensure driving comfort (see also fine balancing). BDS * slat The BDS * slat is the name for a unique slat system from Michelin (* bi-directional system) and refers to a self-locking slat oriented in two directions. Their enormous rigidity ensures better braking and acceleration and optimizes handling on dry and wet roads. BDS slats are used in the new Michelin Alpin and the new Pilot Alpin in H. Brake assistant The brake assistant supports the driver in the event of emergency braking. The background to this is the fact that most drivers do not apply the brakes hard enough in critical situations. Function: A sensor detects the sudden decrease in gas and the rapid depression of the brake pedal, a solenoid valve ventilates the brake booster at lightning speed, which then builds up the full brake pressure. The brake assistant shortens the braking distance from 100 km / h by up to 45%. Brake plates Brake plates can result from blocking braking. At a correspondingly high initial speed, the tires "erase" so violently over the road that they are locally ground off at the blocking point under great heat. As a rule, the tires then "hit" so much that they have to be replaced. CBC The CBC (Cornering Brake Control), a further development of ABS (see there), makes braking in corners even safer and more controllable. Each individual wheel is braked in doses to minimize pushing over the front axle (understeering) or breaking out of the rear (oversteering) when braking in curves. Drainage Drainage (like numerous terms related to cars) comes from French and means "water drainage" from the profile. A tire must have a good drainage effect to ensure safe driving behavior in wet conditions. The drainage speed of a tread can be calculated using computer simulation and the tire made aquaplaning-safe. A distinction is made between longitudinal and transverse drainage. ECE 30 ECE 30 denotes a European directive that is indicated on the tire by the "E-No." is documented. The E no. is individual for each tire version and states that the respective tire has passed the test criteria ECE 30. Since 1.10.1998 tires (which have been produced after this date in Germany (in other European countries such as Austria, France, Great Britain for several years)) can only be used with E no. go on sale. The ECE 30 protects the consumer, among other things. from gross security deficiencies, e.g. can appear in cheap imports. Electronic tires "Electronic tires" - a model for tomorrow's tire technology. The vision: sensors installed in the tire should record the driving conditions (wet, cold, curves, speed, etc.) and automatically adjust the vehicle's tires to the current situation. EM / wheel loaders Earth-moving machines and wheel loaders have a hard job that is very diverse. Our range of branded tires from major manufacturers is just as diverse. No matter what application, for which surface and for which machine you are looking for a tire, we have it! But we do not leave you alone with our offer, we offer you the specialist advice you need - because the right tire choice is an investment decision. We would be happy to support you in using the best economical solution. Energy Energy - this is the brand name for energy-saving tires from MICHELIN. Their specific rubber compounds reduce rolling resistance and thereby help to reduce fuel consumption. Despite these groundbreaking properties, energy tires are equally good or even superior in the other performance requirements that are placed on modern tires. ESP ESP, the electronic stabilization program, is also named differently by some vehicle manufacturers and has become famous due to the "moose test". This system intervenes in critical driving situations and helps the driver to control the vehicle better when driving straight ahead and when cornering by means of targeted braking and influencing the engine torque. The EU tire label Since November 1, 2012, EU Regulation No. 1222/2009, better known as the EU tire label, has applied in all member states of the European Union. From this day, all commercially available tires that were produced after July 1st, 2012 must be labeled with information on rolling resistance, wet grip and external rolling noise. The EU tire label gives you an orientation about the 3 performance characteristics of a tire listed above. However, far more criteria should be used to assess a tire, for example winter characteristics or driving behavior on dry roads. The label should therefore not replace good specialist advice on site. Explanation of the marking The petrol pump symbol stands for fuel efficiency. Reducing the rolling resistance saves fuel and thus CO2. The evaluation is given in classes A (green) to G (red), whereby D is not used. An improvement from one class to the highest means approximately the saving of 0.1 liters of fuel per 100 km. The wet grip of the tires is crucial for driving safety. Here the performance is divided into classes A to G, whereby D and G are not occupied. The braking distance difference from one class to the highest on wet roads at an output speed of 80 km / h is between 1 and 2 vehicle lengths (3 - 6 m or an average of 4.5 m). The external rolling noise of the tires affects the overall volume of the vehicle and affects not only driving comfort, but also the noise level in the environment. The more black bars, the louder the tire. This regulation does not apply to: retreaded tires Off-road tires for commercial use Tires that are designed exclusively for mounting on vehicles, the first registration of which was made before October 1, 1990 emergency tires of type T tires with a permissible speed of less than 80 km / h Tires for rims with a nominal diameter ≤ 254 mm (10 ") or ≥ 635 mm (25") Tires with additional devices to improve traction, e.g. B. Studded tires Tires that are designed exclusively for mounting on vehicles that are only intended for racing. Brand binding Brand binding means: A vehicle manufacturer only allows certain brands of tires for a vehicle model. Very fast vehicles require W or ZR tires. Tire brands and tire types that are approved by the manufacturer are specified in the vehicle registration certificate or are named in the wheel certificate for subsequent retrofitting (see also ABE). Tire make ties for passenger car tires have been lifted since the beginning of 2000. Regardless of the entry in the papers, any tire brand is permitted. Exception: pure ZR tires. They require the manufacturer's approval and an entry in the papers. Fine balancing Fine balancing is a must, at least for the wheels of car steering axles. In this way, residual imbalances that occur due to changed wheel centering, hub and brake disc (see also balancing) are compensated for directly on the vehicle. Grip Grip means liability (see there), is a term from racing and describes the ability of special tires to literally "stick" on the slopes. Grip is achieved through soft rubber compounds and tire working temperatures of 100 - 120 ° C. However, these tires usually only last a few hundred kilometers. Liability Liability describes the ability of a tread rubber compound to bond as intensively as possible to the road, whereby experts distinguish between the macro and micro roughness of the road surface. Adhesion in wet conditions and especially in snow is achieved by a sophisticated slat technology (see there) and special rubber compounds. Date of manufacture The date of manufacture of a tire can be read from the identification number beginning with the letters DOT on the side of the tire. The last three digits stand for the calendar week and the year, e.g. 049 = 4th week of 1999. An additional triangle behind the last digit indicates that the tire dates from the 90s. The DOT number has had four digits since 2000, e.g. 4200. The first two digits indicate the production week, here week 42. The last two digits (00) define the year of manufacture, in this example the year 2000. 01 means 2001. Homologation Homologation is the technical approval of a tire for a certain car model. The entire approval process is handled very strictly by the automobile manufacturers, around 60 test points are taken into account. For the tire manufacturer, every approval means confirmation of the product quality. In Germany, where the designers are particularly demanding, MICHELIN has approvals from all vehicle manufacturers for almost all profiles. Industry / forklift Efficiency and safety are very important for industrial tires. If you have to handle heavy loads, you need a robust foundation. The right tires are an important part of it. We offer you a wide range of excellent tire brands with tried and tested products that have passed pretty much every practical test. It is important for which application your truck is intended and on which surface it is moving. We therefore advise you in detail before we install the right tire. Carcass Carcass is called the basic construction of a tire. The carcass is the decisive strength element of a tire and is completed by belts and treads. As a rule, carcasses consist of rubber-coated textile ropes made of synthetic fibers such as rayon or nylon. Lamellar tires MICHELIN invented lamellar tires as early as the 1930s in order to achieve more grip on slippery cobblestones. In the 80s, MICHELIN developed lamellar tires into a modern winter tire with excellent grip on snow and ice (see also "Alpine" tires). Directional binding Directional binding means: Tire profiles are designed so that they have to roll in the prescribed direction. This is proving itself more and more often and brings advantages in terms of tire performance (noise development, wet properties) and in power transmission on snow and ice. Steering precision Steering precision of tires or vehicles - this means their ability to turn in and out of a curve as precisely as possible and the driving behavior when cornering. High-performance tires (Y, ZR) are usually particularly precise when steering. Truck truck tires are as different as their areas of application. They therefore have different profile pictures, speed indices and load capacities. But no matter whether they are used in local, regional or long-distance transport, whether they are intended for construction sites or off-road: with us you always get the right branded tires from top manufacturers. The right choice of tires has an impact on the economy of your transport. We offer you optimal advice - and of course the associated service too! Load index Load index (load capacity index) is usually a two-digit number at the end of the size designation: e.g. 175/70 R 13 82 T. The number 82 gives information about the load capacity of the tire. Load index 82 means e.g. 475 kg load capacity per tire. Correct air pressure Correct air pressure decides whether the tires can develop their full range of performance such as mileage, cornering grip, fatigue strength, braking distance, etc. It is therefore important: check every 14 days when the tires are cold! Attention: Never lower the air pressure after a long journey! When driving, the tires warm up and the tire air pressure increases automatically (see also "Negative pressure" and "Positive pressure"). Loss of air Loss of air from tires: Since the air molecules slowly escape to the outside even with an airtight tire, the air pressure steadily decreases - albeit only to a small extent. In order to offer drivers maximum safety, MICHELIN uses up to 6 times more airtight butyl in comparison to conventional materials to produce inner tire rubber layers. Sudden loss of air makes the vehicle unstable; It becomes particularly critical when the rear axle is affected because the side guidance of the vehicle suddenly fails. Matching Matching is a tire fitting process that contributes to the optimal concentricity of the tire. The runout errors of the wheel and tire are combined so that they largely neutralize each other. Matching is carried out before the actual balancing! Mixed tires Mixed tires should be avoided if possible. Different types of tires on the front and rear axles can have a negative impact on driving behavior. Winter tires in particular should be fitted "all round". Motorcycles Safety comes first when riding a motorcycle. With motorcycle tires from specialist dealers, you can go on the road or off-road with a good feeling. It goes without saying that we also professionally change and fit your tires! Puncture-proof puncture-proof tires or tires with run-flat properties are not yet commercially available today. In the event of a breakdown, the spare wheel is still installed. With its PAX tire system, MICHELIN has developed a pioneering solution. Even with flat tires you can still drive 200 km, and that at 80 km / h. A sudden loss of air in the tire (see there) also loses its horror. Further advantages of these revolutionary tires: reduction of rolling resistance and fuel consumption, better driving behavior, design advantages for the vehicle manufacturer. Cars The permanent interplay between braking and accelerating puts a strain on the tires. Since they constantly come into contact with the road, they have to be extremely robust and endure a lot. With us you will find the best tires for every vehicle type, every season and every weather - just tires with mature performance. Of course we also offer the optimal service! PR PR means Ply Rating (number of layers) - a term that is only used occasionally for light truck tires for different load-bearing classes. In the past, in connection with diagonal tires, PR was the number of carcass plies. An 8 PR tire has more load capacity than a 6 PR tire. The PR number is replaced today by the load index (see there). Tread depth The tread depth determines how well a tire adheres to damp, wet, snowy or loose surfaces. The lower the tread depth of a tire, the more likely it is to float on water. A dangerous film then forms between the surface of the road and the tire, a process also known as aquaplaning. As a precaution, you should check the profile depth regularly. In Germany, a minimum profile depth of 1.6 mm is required. Michelin uses wear indicators in the main tread grooves of its tires for easy control. A small BIB symbol in the shoulder area of ​​each Michelin tire reveals where these places can be found. Changing wheels Changing wheels from front to back and vice versa always makes sense and is recommended after approx. 10,000 to 15,000 km. By changing the wheels, the tires are run more evenly and can be completely replaced later. If you only have two new tires fitted, these "better" tires always belong on the rear axle, regardless of the type of drive (also applies to all-wheel drive). Because the grip of the tires on the rear axle is decisive for the guidance of the vehicle, especially in curves. Radial tires Radial tires were introduced by Michelin in 1948 (X technology). To this day, their principle is based on a clear separation of the functions in the tire substructure - radially arranged carcass plies for better deflection and stabilizing belt plies under the tread. The effect was a significant increase in tire performance with practically all important requirements. Compared to the diagonal tires with several diagonally crossed carcass plies that were common in the early days of the automobile, the first radial tires ran more than twice as long. There were also dramatic improvements in terms of wet grip, driving precision, cornering grip and comfort. Tire size Here you will find an explanation of the information on your tire Width: 185 Cross section: 60 inch size: 14 Load capacity: 82 Speed: H WIDTH Width on the tread in mm. You will find this information - On the tire: 185/60 R 14 82H - In the vehicle documents: 185/60 R 14 82H CROSS-SECTION Tire cross-section: Ratio of flank height to tire width in percent. You will find this information - On the tire: 185/60 R 14 82H - In the vehicle documents: 185/60 R 14 82H INCH SIZE Inch size = rim diameter = inner tire diameter The rim diameter is determined diagonally from rim edge to rim edge, the measurement is usually given in inches. You will find this information - On the rim: 6Jx 14 H2 ET28 - On the tire: 185/60 R 14 82H - In the vehicle documents: 185/60 R 14 82H LOAD CAPACITY The load capacity index indicates the load capacity of the tire. A certain maximum load in kilograms is assigned to each value. The assembled tires must have at least the load index specified in the vehicle documents or higher. You will find this information - On the tire: 185/60 R 14 82H - In the vehicle documents: 185/60 R 14 82H SPEED The speed index indicates the maximum permitted driving speed with the affected tires. Each class is assigned a certain maximum speed in km / h. The tires fitted must have at least the speed index specified in the vehicle documents or higher. You can find this information - on the tire: 185/60 R 14 82H - in the vehicle documents: 185/60 R 14 82H class BCDEFGJKLMNPQRSTU km / h 50 60 65 70 80 90 100 110 120 130 140 150 160 170 180 190 200 class HVWY VR ZR km / h 210 240 270 300> 210> 240 Tire recycling Tire recycling, i.e. the material recovery of rubber (tires, rubber products), is still a dream of the future today, but is already the subject of research. Currently, used tires are used for energy generation or are used in shredded form as rubber granules (without steel cables) e.g. for bead strips, park benches, sports floors and whisper asphalt. Reinforced Reinforced is an additional name for car tires that have been specially reinforced. This means they can carry higher loads when the air pressure is higher and are also better protected against mechanical injuries. Spare wheel The spare wheel is often in a deep sleep. In the first instance, the spare tire will not have enough air. Another common problem: The wheel nuts of the aluminum wheels do not fit the usual steel wheel! Tip from MICHELIN: Include the spare wheel in the regular tire change. Of course, this does not apply to emergency bikes. Also important: don't forget to check the air pressure! Rolling resistance Rolling resistance is the force that a rolling tire opposes propulsion. This resistance arises primarily from the "flexing work" of the tire, i.e. due to its deformation when passing through the ground contact area. Amazing, but true: up to about 100 km / h, the rolling resistance is greater than the air resistance of the vehicle! That is why "green tires" are becoming more and more important. the MICHELIN Energy. This innovative tire reduces rolling resistance by 30%, which leads to a reduction in fuel consumption of up to 5% and has a corresponding environmental impact. Retreaded retreaded tires are ecologically interesting because after the "first tire life" around 3/4 of the raw materials used can be recycled - in the form of the carcass. A new tread is vulcanized onto this, whereby the tire is given a "new" profile. Especially with larger tires, e.g. for trucks, the use of retreaded tires is sensible and economical. Under the name "REMIX", MICHELIN has developed a particularly high-quality retreading process. Concentricity of rotation You can feel and measure the concentricity of tires. However, most drivers only feel the difference when they re-tire their car all around. By the way: MICHELIN tires enjoy the reputation of excellent concentricity with vehicle manufacturers and tire retailers. (See also "Uniformity")! Sawtooth Sawtooth is what tire technicians call the non-uniform abrasion on the transverse edges of tread blocks in the tire's direction of travel. In advanced stages, saw teeth often cause annoying vibrations and running noises. This can be avoided if you switch between the front and rear axles in good time. In stubborn cases, however, you should ask the tire specialist for advice (see also changing wheels). Slip Slip is the difference between the geometric wheel circumference and the distance actually traveled during one wheel revolution. 100% slip occurs when the wheels spin or lock. So the greater the driving or braking forces, the greater the slip. Even if you don't notice it: there is always a small amount of slip when driving - hence tire wear! Shoulder abrasion One-sided shoulder abrasion occurs especially when the position of the wheel in relation to the road is not optimal. Then you should check the track or camber. Shoulder abrasion on both sides is mostly due to negative air pressure (see there) or overload. Anyone who drives sportily and with a high proportion of country roads (curves!) Is affected by increased tire abrasion on the outer shoulders, even if the axis setting is correct. In such cases, it is advisable to turn the tire on the rim and change it from right to left. Exception: directional profiles! Silicate Silicate is a recently used filler for rubber compounds (chemically known as silica). Silicate can be used to improve the wet grip of tires and reduce rolling resistance. Slicks Slicks - that is the name of the treadless racing tires with an extremely adhesive tread compound. In wet conditions, slick tires can quickly get into trouble, then profiled rain tires are needed. Slicks are therefore unsuitable for everyday use. They also rarely last longer than 1,000 km. Speed ​​Index Speed ​​Index is a speed symbol, a letter at the end of the size designation, which provides information about the maximum permitted maximum speed of the tire. 195/65 R15 91 HS = up to 180 km / h, T = up to 190 km / h, H = up to 210 km / h, V = up to 240 km / h, W = up to 270 km / h, Y = up to 300 km / h, ZR = over 240 km / h steel wheels / aluminum rims Would you like chic wheels for your vehicle? Do you need another set of wheels for your summer or winter tires? No problem! We offer a wide range of alloy wheels and steel wheels from leading manufacturers that match your tires and your car. Choosing the right bike doesn't just depend on the design. It is also important to observe the general technical conditions. Our rim configurator does a lot of work for you. It allows you to choose the bike that you like best from the technically possible options. Current offers For the rim configurator SUV / 4x4 tires (off-road tires) SUV (sport utility vehicles) and classic off-road vehicles have been enjoying increasing popularity in recent years. The demand for the right SUV / 4x4 tires too. And because not every off-road vehicle is only used off-road, but also drives on the road, we have the right tires for every terrain - whether "Mud Terrain", "All Terrain" or "Street Terrain". No matter whether muddy, rocky-hard underground or asphalt road. Traction Traction is the ability to convert engine power into propulsion by interlocking with the road surface. Traction is not a problem on dry roads. Traction becomes poor only when it is wet, snow or ice. Then the adhesive properties of the rubber compound and the shape of the tread (slat tires for snow) play a decisive role (see slats). Transporter and light truck Transporter or light truck (light truck) tires are subject to heavy loads. They have to carry heavy loads, often come into contact with curbs and are driven at very high speeds when using the motorway. Transporter tires therefore have, among other things, a reinforced substructure to ensure the required load capacity. Safety and robustness are therefore key requirements placed on these tires. But the cost-effectiveness of the product to be selected is also one of the decisive factors for choosing the right tire. And of course there are also summer and winter tires for vans. Make the right choice - let us advise you! Over-air pressure Over-air pressure is almost as harmful as under-air pressure. Shock absorbers and comfort suffer, the grip worsens and the tires also wear out faster and more unevenly (center wear). Uniformity Uniformity is what tire technicians call the manufacturing accuracy of a tire. Uniformity is a prerequisite for perfect and quiet unrolling - without disturbing noises and vibrations. The better the uniformity of the tire, the easier it is to balance the wheel. - Just ask a tire fitter about the "Uniformity" of Michelin tires (see also "Concentricity")! Under-air pressure Unfortunately, under-air pressure is the rule rather than the exception these days. The tires are getting better, consequence: negligence in maintenance. Those who drive with too little air have many disadvantages and take safety risks: impairment of the fatigue strength, possible tire failure, spongy driving behavior, reduced mileage of the tires, increased fuel consumption. Therefore: The air pressure should be checked every 14 days, especially when the tires are cold! Valves Valves tire just as much as tires, especially when they are rubber valves, as is common with steel wheels. Strong centrifugal forces, dirt on the road and brake wear clog the valves. Tip from MICHELIN: Have the valves replaced every time you change tires. Valve caps Valve caps - the most inconspicuous parts on the wheel are still very important: They protect the actual valve from dirt and moisture and guarantee complete tightness of the wheel-tire system. Vibrations Vibrations on the steering wheel usually originate from poorly balanced tires, which can often be eliminated by matching (see there) the tire. However, vibrations can also be triggered by a faulty or dropped balance weight or by a brake plate created after a violent braking (see there!). The tire specialist recognizes the cause of the problem and gives you competent advice. VTS slat VTS slat means Variable Thickness Sipe and refers to a slat system for high-performance tires up to 240 km / h - with "self-locking" slats for optimal power transmission, excellent handling and superior steering precision. VTS slats are used in the new Pilot Alpin in V. Winter tires Winter tires with their special treads and rubber compounds offer the greatest possible safety in all winter road conditions. Often not known is the fact that rubber compounds of winter tires harden later at low temperatures and therefore enable shorter braking distances and therefore more safety even at temperatures below approx. 7 ° C, and that on dry and wet surfaces. Y-sipes Y-sipes are a Michelin invention for winter tires. Raffiniert geformte y-förmige Profilschnitte führen zu einer Verdoppelung der Profilkanten nach ca. 1/3 Laufzeit. Das Ergebnis ist genial: Trotz abnehmender Profiltiefe ergibt sich ein sensationell guter Winter-Grip (siehe "Lamellenreifen" und "Alpin"). Z-Lamellen Z-Lamellen - eine weitere Michelin Erfindung - sind z-förmig zum Radmittelpunkt hin angeordnet. Dadurch ergibt sich ein Abstützeffekt, der gute Traktion, ausgezeichnete Haftung und messerscharfe Lenkpräzision (s. jeweils dort) ermöglicht. Z-Lamellen werden überwiegend bei Winterreifen und im Hochleistungsbereich (Pilot Alpin) eingesetzt. Je nach gewünschter Leistungsfähigkeit sind gleichläufige und gegenläufige Z-Lamellen-Ausführungen erhältlich Reifenangebote Reifen ab 39â‚¬ Felgenangebote Felgen ab 65 Euro Felgen Konfigurator Konfigurator Einkaufsgesellschaft Freier ReifenfachhÃ¤ndler Wo Service Chefsache ist.
