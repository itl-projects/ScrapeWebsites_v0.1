Professional service as well as compliance with jointly fixed fleet-specific requirements in the tire and wheel sector and sometimes also with car service is a matter of course for us. Since 01.09.2015 we have joined the processing system of the car and tire expert Euromaster in the area of ​​leasing and fleet processing. This means that leasing and fleet customers can access a largely uniform range of services in around 700 German and 58 Austrian specialist companies. The shared fleet and leasing network ensures that our customers almost always find a reliable tire and car service partner in their area. The use of the online authorization system enables the vehicle to be clearly identified in EFR operation. This ensures that the services and conditions defined in the framework contract are observed. Deviations from these agreements are subject to the approval of the leasing company or your fleet management. Our offer has been tested by several selected leasing companies and rated as consistently positive. We are working with Euromaster to gradually expand and refine our range of services.
