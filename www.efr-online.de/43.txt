From this day, all commercially available tires that were produced after July 1st, 2012 must be labeled with information on rolling resistance, wet grip and external rolling noise. The EU tire label gives you an orientation about the 3 performance characteristics of a tire listed above. However, far more criteria should be used to assess a tire, for example winter characteristics or driving behavior on dry roads. The label should therefore not replace good specialist advice on site. Explanation of the marking The petrol pump symbol stands for fuel efficiency. By reducing the rolling resistance, fuel and thus CO2 are saved. The evaluation is given in classes A (green) to G (red), whereby D is not used. An improvement from one class to the highest means approximately the saving of 0.1 liters of fuel per 100 km. The wet grip of the tires is crucial for driving safety. Here the performance is divided into classes A to G, whereby D and G are not occupied. The braking distance difference from one class to the highest on wet roads at an initial speed of 80 km / h is between 1 and 2 vehicle lengths (3 - 6 m or an average of 4.5 m). The external rolling noise of the tires affects the overall volume of the vehicle and affects not only driving comfort, but also the noise level in the environment. The more black bars, the louder the tire. This regulation does not apply to: retreaded tires Off-road tires for commercial use Tires that are designed exclusively for mounting on vehicles, the first registration of which was made before October 1, 1990 emergency tires of the type T tires with a permissible speed of less than 80 km / h Tires for rims with a nominal diameter ≤ 254 mm (10 ") or ≥ 635 mm (25") Tires with additional devices to improve traction, e.g. B. Studded tires Tires that are designed exclusively for mounting on vehicles that are only intended for racing.
