It all started with grandfather Paul Kranz, who drove the ladies of fine society in a luxurious Steyr almost a century ago. The Mercedes Benz 190DC, which he bought in the 1960s, was his greatest treasure and is still part of the classic car service Kranz fleet that is used for wedding trips. The grandfather's enthusiasm rubbed off and at the age of seventeen, owner Hubert Kranz bought his first own classic car, a 220S Ponton Mercedes. Hubert Kranz lovingly restored it and has not been able to get rid of the classic cars since then, even if it took some time before the hobby became a classic car. In 2001 Hubert Kranz once again bought a classic car, this time via the PreWarCar platform, which specializes in pre-war vehicles. The purchase not only gave Hubert Kranz a 1925 Cleveland, but also a lasting friendship and business relationship with classic car enthusiast Joris Bergsma, who ran the PreWarCar website. This was how the classic car service Kranz was created the following year, at which point the focus was already on the English pre-war vehicles. In addition to the classic car sales and stylish wedding trips, all other services relating to the classic car were gradually added to the program, so that customers from all over the world can not only buy classic cars from Hubert Kranz today, but also a classic car workshop in Straelen on the Lower Rhine with everything that goes with it , Find.
