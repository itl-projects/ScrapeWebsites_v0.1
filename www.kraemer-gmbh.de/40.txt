Therefore, the brake system should be checked regularly for your safety! The wear on the brakes does not happen overnight, but usually develops over a longer period of time. The braking distance becomes longer - without you noticing it - or your vehicle "pulls" to one side when braking. Brake fluid that is too old can start to boil during strong braking maneuvers, since brake fluid attracts moisture. If the water content is greater than 3%, vapor bubbles form, which can lead to a serious failure of the braking system. Therefore, have your brake system checked regularly by a specialist. This gives you the security you need! Brake calipers Brake pads Brake discs Brake fluid Brake hoses and many other brake components Make an appointment with us today!
