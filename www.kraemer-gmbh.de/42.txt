We also pay up to € 25 for a taxi home. And if the breakdown location is more than 50 km away from your place of residence, we will pay up to € 300 for the replacement car (for the duration of the repair) or organize and finance your journey home or onward travel by train. If the train journey took longer than eight hours, even by plane. We also assume the travel costs that arise when you pick up your repaired vehicle from a point S service center further away. There for you all over Europe: The point S mobility guarantee will also help you free of charge in other European countries: We will transport your vehicle if it cannot be repaired abroad or procure the necessary spare parts. We cover up to € 300 travel and accommodation costs in the event of theft or total damage to your car. And we also help by phone: with mediation to the nearest point S service center.
