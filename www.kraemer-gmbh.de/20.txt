A high mileage with low rolling resistance is a central criterion for the economy of these tires. In addition, van tires now combine the advantages of a car tire. This includes low rolling noise, excellent steering behavior and optimal driving behavior on wet roads. So-called C tires ("commercial" tires) are used especially for vans and vans. They have a reinforced substructure and thus a higher load capacity. Reinforced tires (RF tires) or XL tires (Extra Load) are being used more and more. We are happy to help you choose the right transporter tire for you! Address / Contact Manfred Krämer GmbH & Co.
