Can I choose any rim for my car? No, there are a number of parameters that you have to take into account. For example, the total wheel diameter must correspond to the original diameter. Contact us for more information and to make the correct tire and rim composition or use our conversion tool. Use the Denco conversion tool. What is the best maintenance for my rims? It is recommended to wash your rims regularly. If you are unsure about which products to use, use water with a mild soap without wax. Always rinse the rims well in advance and at the end. Never wash your rims if you have just driven. If the brakes are still too hot and suddenly cooled by throwing water over them, a (colored) deposit may form on your rims. Feel free to contact us for more information about cleaning different types of rims such as monoblock, multi-part rims, polished rims and chromed rims. What do I do if there is a dent in my rim? For safety reasons, it is best to have that dent checked as soon as possible. We can repair most (minor) damages.
