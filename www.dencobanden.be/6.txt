Modern tires perform well in the most diverse weather conditions. When wet, it is important to have tires with a special tread design that ensures good water drainage, giving you better contact with the road surface. To guarantee optimal safety during winter conditions, you can opt for the winter tire. These belts are preferably mounted at average temperatures from 7 ° C and below. For more information about tires in general, you can always contact us without obligation. We are happy to help you. When do my tires need to be replaced? The legal minimum tread depth of a tire is 1.6 mm, but we strongly recommend that you replace your tire at 2 mm. When measuring the groove depth of your tire, it is best to check both the inner and outer edges of your tire. Uneven tire wear is usually a sign of poor vehicle alignment. For more information, please refer to the relevant page of this website. When you have your car tires replaced at Denco Tires, we always change them in pairs unless you just placed new ones and you have now damaged 1 tire beyond repair. Why and when do I check my tire pressure? A voltage that is too low results in more fuel costs due to increased resistance. The life of the tire is also shortened by 25% due to increased wear. You always check the tire pressure when the tires are cold. This is possible at various filling stations and you can of course also contact Denco Tires. We are also happy to help you with additional explanations and advice. The appropriate tire pressure for your tires and car can be found in the manual of your car or is sometimes even applied to a sticker on the car. When checking the tire pressure, don't forget your spare tire! This way you avoid double breakdown in case of a flat tire. Correct tire pressure protects your tires! Can I have each tire mounted on my car? No, you need the PVG number to know which tires you can mount. You can find this number on the certificate of conformity for your car and on your registration certificate. You can then visit the GOCA website to find out which tires are allowed. www.goca.be/banden/pvg_n.asp How far can I drive with a new tire? This differs from car to car and also depends on your driving style. For example, 40,000 km for the front tires and 80,000 km for the rear tires is a good average for a front-wheel drive vehicle. Why do my tires wear unevenly? Uneven tire wear may indicate poor shock absorbers or misalignment. For more information on alignment, please visit the appropriate page of this website. What do the information on the side of my tires mean? Example: 205/55 R 16 91V 205 = Tire width in mm 55 = Ratio of side height to tire width (here 55% of 205 mm) R = Radial. Another possibility could be D (Diagonal). There should never be 2 different types on the same axle 16 = Diameter of the wheel in inches 91 = Load index (LI) which expresses how much weight a tire can carry. The full Load index can be found below in tabular form V = Speed ​​code expressing the maximum permissible speed. All speed codes can also be found in the second table below. Load index: LI Kg LI Kg LI Kg LI Kg LI Kg LI Kg 60 = 250 80 = 450 100 = 800 120 = 1400 140 = 2500 160 = 4500 61 = 257 81 = 257 101 = 825 121 = 1450 141 = 2575 161 = 4625 62 = 265 82 = 475 102 = 850 122 = 1500 142 = 2650 162 = 4750 63 = 272 83 = 487 103 = 875 123 = 1550 143 = 2725 163 = 4875 64 = 280 84 = 500 104 = 900 124 = 1600 144 = 2800 164 = 5000 65 = 290 85 = 515 105 = 925 125 = 1650 145 = 2900 165 = 5150 66 = 300 86 = 530 106 = 950 126 = 1700 146 = 3000 166 = 5300 67 = 307 87 = 545 107 = 975 127 = 1750 147 = 3075 167 = 5450 68 = 315 88 = 560 108 = 1000 128 = 1800 148 = 3150 168 = 5600 69 = 325 89 = 580 109 = 1030 129 = 1850 149 = 3250 169 = 5800 70 = 335 90 = 600 110 = 1060 130 = 1900 150 = 3350 170 = 6000 71 = 345 91 = 615 111 = 1090 131 = 1950 151 = 3450 171 = 6150 72 = 355 92 = 630 112 = 1120 132 = 2000 152 = 3550 172 = 6300 73 = 365 93 = 650 113 = 1150 133 = 2060 153 = 3650 173 = 6500 74 = 375 94 = 670 114 = 1180 134 = 2120 154 = 3750 174 = 6700 7 5 = 387 95 = 690 115 = 1215 135 = 2180 155 = 3875 175 = 6900 76 = 400 96 = 710 116 = 1250 136 = 2240 156 = 4000 176 = 7100 77 = 412 97 = 730 117 = 1285 137 = 2300 157 = 4125 177 = 7300 78 = 425 98 = 750 118 = 1320 138 = 2360 158 = 4250 178 = 7500 79 = 437 99 = 775 119 = 1360 139 = 2430 159 = 4375 179 = 7750 Speed ​​code: F = 80 km / h N = 140 km / h H = 210 km / h G = 90 km / h P = 150 km / h V = 240 km / h J = 100 km / h Q = 160 km / h W = 270 km / h K = 110 km / h R = 170 km / h Y = 300 km / h L = 120 km / h S = 180 km / h ZR => 240 km / h M = 130 km / h T = 190 km / h Opening hours Shop Monday to Friday : 6am to 6pm Saturday: 7am to 12pm Sunday: closed Opening hours tire center Mon to Fri: 9am to 12pm and from 1pm to 6pm Sat: 9am to 12pm Sun: closed Some of our brands: Copyright Denco Tires | Contact us | Website by Publivisie
