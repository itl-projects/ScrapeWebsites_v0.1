After all, wheels are placed at a certain angle for good maneuverability and minimal tire wear. That angle must be maintained. It is also important that the tire / wheel combination of your car is in the correct balance. With the help of modern balancing equipment we can determine the size and position of possible imbalance. Then we can apply the exact amount of balancing lead in the right place. On this page you will also receive answers to the following questions: What happens if my car is misaligned? Poor wheel alignment can cause abnormal tire wear and increased fuel consumption. If your car is misaligned, you must make constant adjustments while driving. Poor alignment also causes faster wear of mechanical parts and results in less safety and comfort. One-sided wear is due to misalignment of the front or rear wheels. This is called toe-in or toe-out and we can always remedy this. Sloping wear is due to excessive positive or negative camber, in other words, the wheels are slanted. This is called positive or negative wheel travel and we can usually remedy this. When aligning, we determine the correct wheel position opposite the driving line of the car so that it drives perfectly straight.
