It is a driver of innovation for environmentally friendly technology and at the same time a central platform for environmental policy exchange between business, politics and administration. We support the close dialogue between all parties involved and thus create more transparency for official decisions on environmental issues. Competent support for better environmental protection The sponsors of the Environmental Partnership are the Hamburg Senate, the Hamburg Chamber of Commerce, the Hamburg Chamber of Crafts, the Hamburg Industry Association and the Hamburg Port Industry Association. In 2013, the Hamburg economy and the Senate agreed to continue the Environmental Partnership for another five years. The Environmental Partnership will continue to offer Hamburg companies competent support and attractive offers to improve their environmental performance in the future.
