Usually with an opposing vehicle, in which case the person responsible for the accident is liable. Furthermore, the free choice of the assessor applies in the event of an accident through no fault of your own. If you have had an accident through no fault of your own, the opposing motor vehicle liability insurance is obliged to compensate for personal injury, damage to property and damage to property Restoration of the previous state of damage is required. This also includes the costs of commissioning an independent vehicle expert / vehicle expert. In order to be able to assert your claim for damages, you must first prove the amount of damage. As evidence, you basically have the right to determine yourself who determines the damage, i.e. you have the right without reservation to determine your own vehicle expert / vehicle expert who will determine your claim for damages, even if the insurance company tries to process the claims itself by sending its own vehicle expert / vehicle expert to assess your vehicle. You do not have to accept the expert opinion commissioned by the insurance company In addition to the costs for the motor vehicle expert / car expert, all costs for a lawyer are borne entirely by the opposing liability insurance and can therefore be charged to you free of charge Unfortunately, you do not make a claim against your own insurance. Since your insurance company regulates the damage (comprehensive damage), it is entitled to issue instructions in the event of comprehensive damage and can have the expert opinion or the cost estimate drawn up by a cooperation partner Consult your own insurance company or contact us. 24 hour hotline: 040 - 87 50 12 47info@hs-smartrepair.dewww.hs-smartrepair.deAlsterdorfer Str. 218, 22297 HamburgMo. - Fri. 8:00 a.m. to 6:00 p.m. Saturday 9:00 a.m. to 3:30 p.m. First name, last name Mandatory field Your email address Mandatory field Your telephone number Mandatory field Your message Mandatory field Captcha unfortunately failed Your message has been sent successfully © 2017 H&S Smartrepair GmbH This website uses cookies to improve user friendliness.I understand.More information.
