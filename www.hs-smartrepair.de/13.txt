Ambitious, the only managing director, F. Hilke, stirred the advertising drum and made first contacts to large car dealerships. The effort quickly bore fruit and the speed and quality got around so that the team had to be increased again after only a short time. In the same year, the company was the only smart repair company in northern Germany to receive the DEKRA seal "ISO 9001: 2008". This was now the definitive guide for future business areas. In addition to the continuous award "workshop of trust, chosen by the driver", the City of Hamburg has also given the company the "Environmental Partnership Seal". The team continued to grow and in 2014 the business area was expanded to include paint and body maintenance. A paint master was also brought in, as well as a body builder. With the know-how from the first few hours and the qualified team, the company is now a specialist in all areas. In 2015, the starting signal was given to expand the workshop. The old drying plant and paint booth had to give way and one of the most modern paint booths was built. Not only can prices remain stable, but the already high quality has been set to a new level. Downtimes and runs were optimized at the same time. In 2016, the construction was completed, but it did not take long for these capacities to reach their limits. In the same year, the office wing was spun off and newly integrated from the outside. In 2017, after the increase in staff, this construction phase was also completed. mp424 hour hotline: 040 - 87 50 12 47info@hs-smartrepair.dewww.hs-smartrepair.deAlsterdorfer Str. 218, 22297 HamburgMo. - Fri. 8:00 a.m. to 6:00 p.m. Saturday 9:00 a.m. to 3:30 p.m. First name, last name Mandatory field Your email address Mandatory field Your telephone number Mandatory field Your message Mandatory field Captcha unfortunately failed Your message has been sent successfully © 2017 H&S Smartrepair GmbH This website uses cookies to improve user friendliness.I understand.More information.
