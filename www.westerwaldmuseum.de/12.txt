As the owner The old-timer treasure trove, which had been a household name for all friends of elderly two-wheelers for years, we have now decided to make our treasures accessible to a wide audience, which has been even easier since we opened our museum in 1995 in a larger hall have reopened. As friends of the BMW brand, you will of course encounter a lot of BMW motorcycles and accessories in our museum. There are also other brands in our collection, such as Zündapp, Horex, Kreidler, NSU and other more or less well-known brands, but not only motorcycles, but also many other items that deal with the topics of mobility and life in the Westerwald , can be admired with us. We hope that you will have as much pleasure and fun viewing our exhibition as we had in the collection. Large parking lot directly opposite the museum - also for coaches!
