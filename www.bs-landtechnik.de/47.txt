B + S Agricultural technology on tour .... B + S Agricultural technology on tour .... We have eventful and interesting fair weekends behind us. B + S Agricultural Technology was on three occasions ... on tour. We exhibited at "Lebens-Art" - a trade fair for garden and lifestyle - in Döbbelin (Stendal) and Redefin. Furthermore, we were able to present our range to many people at our stand at the "PRIMA fair" in Heinrichsfelde. The "Tango" (John Deere carover) ran, mowed automatically and was a real visitor magnet. Many interested people took the opportunity to test sit on the lawn tractors, there were queues at the combine and our sales people had a lot of good conversations. It was tried, studied and tested! It was a great day for us. We thank all visitors for your interest. So that you can see how nice it was, here are some impressions: -> from the "LebensArt" fair from Redefin: -> from the "LebensArt" fair from Döbbelin (Stendal): -> from the "PRIMA" fair from Heinrichsfelde (Kyritz): advertising information B + S Landtechnik GmbH Lassahner Straße 21 19300 Grabow Tel. +49 38756 33-0 Fax +49 38756 33-19 info (at) bs-landtechnik (dot) de B + S Landtechnik GmbH branch Neustadt Commercial area North 1-2 16845 Neustadt / Dosse Tel. +49 33970 880-0 Fax +49 33970 880-129 neustadt (at) bs-landtechnik (dot) de Service branch office Klietz Sandauer Straße 17 39524 Klietz Tel. +49 39327 348 Fax + 49 39327 939966 neustadt (at) bs-landtechnik (dot) de B + S Landtechnik GmbH Branch Osterburg Schilddorf 12 39606 Osterburg Tel. +49 3937 2920-0 Fax +49 3937 2920-25 osterburg (at) bs-landtechnik (dot) Edit cookie settings Data protection declaration Imprint Legal information Sitemap B + S Landtechnik GmbH, John Deere Sales partner Grabow, Neustadt / Dosse, Klietz, Osterburg VAT: DE137688842 John Deere Sales partner Germany
