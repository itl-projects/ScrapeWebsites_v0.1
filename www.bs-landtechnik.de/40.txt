The opportunity introduced by the inner-German turn was used. As a partner of well-known agricultural machinery manufacturers such as We started the company John Deere, the world's largest manufacturer of agricultural technology, on January 2, 1992 with 20 highly motivated employees at the Grabow location in the existing buildings. In 1948 August Bruns (1916-1991) founded an agricultural machinery trade and repair company in Cloppenburg. To date, several legally independent agricultural engineering companies with various branches throughout Northern Germany have emerged as a family business. Until 1991, H. Schmidt worked for almost 20 years in the agricultural engineering district in Grabow. The company development concept, advised by the shareholders with the employees taken over, envisaged continuous redesign (new construction) of buildings and systems. The first major investment was accordingly made in 1996 in the form of a new construction of the sales, office and warehouse building, including large parts of the courtyard fortifications. 6 new jobs were created. The training of agricultural machinery mechanics, wholesalers and office clerks started in the new premises and has been very successful to this day. So far, all of the young people we have trained have achieved their training goal, so far there has been no termination of their apprenticeship later 4 weeks after the start of the training the takeover of a specialist agricultural machinery company based in the north of Altmark took place. B + S Landtechnik's commitment to the Altmark began with this company. In 2002, an operation in Osterburg that was literally on the green field was handed over to the branch manager Mr. Busch. A better traffic connection for customers and suppliers and last but not least the optimization of all internal processes made this new building necessary. The acceptance by customers and thus the successful development of the new company confirm the decision for a completely new building. In 2010, B + S Landtechnik took over the John Deere area responsibility for the greater Neustadt / Dosse and Klietz area. Assuming responsibility for the area gave B + S Landtechnik the opportunity to continue to grow, thereby expanding the range of services related to agricultural and municipal technology and tire service. The branch manager Mr. Schumacher is not only responsible for the branch in Neustadt / Dosse, but also for the Klietz location, which is a trustworthy contact for machine service and machine consulting for customers in the region. Stefan Sprock has been the company's managing director since 01/01/2014 B + S Landtechnik GmbH and replaced Mr. Schmidt after 23 years of targeted management. After training as an agricultural machinery mechanic, Mr. Sprock completed a degree in mechanical engineering. After completing his dual engineering studies in Vechta / Diepholz and international activities at Grimme, BASF, Claas and AGCO, Mr. Sprock took up his position in Grabow. Mr. Sprock has been a managing partner since 2017. B + S Landtechnik GmbH meanwhile employs over 100 people in the fields of agricultural technology, municipal technology and tire service.
