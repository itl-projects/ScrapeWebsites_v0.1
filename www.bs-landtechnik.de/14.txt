The 410 hp (nominal power) on four caterpillars literally glide over the ground - even with heavy tillage. A total weight of up to 24 t rests on the floor without it being affected. The 8RX's ground pressure is just 0.5 bar. The new e23 gearbox and the new cab with 65 ° swiveling Active Seat II (45 ° to the right and 20 ° to the left) including heating, ventilation and massage functions provide additional comfort at the workplace.The powerful design of the 8R series tractors / RT / RX anticipates it: immense traction and technology, which brings modern agriculture forward. Simply unbeatable!
