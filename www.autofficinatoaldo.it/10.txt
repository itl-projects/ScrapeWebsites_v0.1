Auto Coupon The first auto coupon? We will do it for you! Thanks to Regulation 1400/2002 CE (also called Monti), since 2002, you can do the Auto coupon anywhere, not only in the dealership! In other words, the periodic checks required by the warranty booklet (the so-called coupons) they can also be performed by independent repairers provided that they are carried out in compliance with the procedures listed in the technical information (available for a fee for professionals) and that original or equivalent quality spare parts are used. These provisions issued to protect consumers are unfortunately still unknown to the majority of car owners under warranty who are mistakenly convinced that they still have to comply with the old rules that claimed to void the warranty in the event of any intervention carried out at independent workshops. We therefore undertake to carry out also the first coupon of your car in compliance with the regulations in force. After our intervention, THE WARRANTY DOES NOT DECADE, and the dealer is obliged to supply it in the event of repairs under warranty.
