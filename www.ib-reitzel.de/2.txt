Larger squares and areas in particular offer an optimal combination of aesthetics and usability with the right design. The prerequisite for this is the careful execution of all paving work according to the rules of craftsmanship. However, you can meet a lot of small subcontractors, especially when it comes to paving. It is in the client's particular interest that the quality is assessed and ensured by an external body. We have been committed to this right from the start: We are a founding member of the Association for Quality Assurance Paving Construction, which was founded by numerous construction companies, planners and local authorities. With our know-how, we want to help ensure that paving is given the status it deserves in municipal road construction. In addition to the professionally experienced assessment of planning, construction and results, this also includes an open discussion with residents, site managers and the politically responsible.
