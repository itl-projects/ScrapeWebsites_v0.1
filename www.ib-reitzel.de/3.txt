In the field of traditional sports fields, you benefit from our extensive experience with different surfaces - lawn, artificial turf and tennis courts as well as terrazzo surfaces for roller skating rinks. When planning sports halls, it is often a question of the sports field also being used for other events. The structural precautions must be taken accordingly.
