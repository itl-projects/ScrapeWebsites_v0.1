It is a non-hazardous, water-soluble liquid, specially developed to treat exhaust gases and ensure that vehicles meet the emission standard. The majority of heavy commercial vehicles that comply with Euro 4 or Euro 5 legislation use AdBlue®. How does AdBlue® work? AdBlue® is automatically mixed with exhaust gases. The NOx emissions in the SCR catalyst are then broken down to water and nitrogen. How can AdBlue® be refueled? AdBlue® can be refueled in our station in 10L bottles or directly at the pump with all payment cards at the outdoor terminals, this 24h / 24h 7/7.
