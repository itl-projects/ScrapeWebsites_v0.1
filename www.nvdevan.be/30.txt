Petrol available at the pump contains, in addition to petroleum hydrocarbons, biofuels. These are renewable fuels made from raw materials of biological origin. From 1 January 2017, petrol stations in Belgium are required by the government to sell Eurosuper 95 E10. From that date, the percentage of bioethanol in the petrol will increase to a maximum of 10 percent. Bioethanol is an alcohol that is sustainably produced from biomass. In the designation "E10" the "E" stands for ethanol and "10" for 10 percent. The reason for this change is that the European guidelines for the application of renewable energy stimulate the use of biofuels. The main reason for this obligatory admixture of bioethanol is that it contributes to the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions. Since the composition of the new petrol will be different, Shell will change the name from "Eurosuper 95" to "Eurosuper 95 E10". The vast majority of cars produced after the year 2000 are suitable for Eurosuper 95 E10. On www.e10.belgie.be you can find more information about E10 and check whether your vehicle is suitable. If a vehicle is not suitable for Eurosuper 95 E10, it can use Shell V-Power, as it does not contain any bioethanol.
