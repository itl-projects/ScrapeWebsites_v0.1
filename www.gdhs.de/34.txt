As the name suggests, the meeting is aimed at the car masters of the individual partner companies. The event not only informs the participants about the new regulations to be adjusted in the industry, but also always has a technically oriented part. In workshops, GDHS suppliers demonstrate the latest developments and devices and are available to the participants for further discussions at the specially organized in-house exhibition. The participants of the master meeting get a good overview of the know-how and equipment that must be available in the workshops.
