Since 1986, tire retailers have been joining the concept who want to assert themselves in tough competition with an individual market presence. Retail partners who choose to market the Goodyear and Dunlop brands above average can become part of our retail marketing initiative and benefit from our wealth of experience and specialist marketing know-how, which is a valuable support when selling tires and services. Trade-related, individually tailored advertising measures for our partners on site, especially during the classic changeover periods, are part of our offer, like our dealer homepage packages with integrated online appointment planner. In addition, our partners benefit from numerous exclusive GDHS services, such as the fleet management of the 4Fleet Group, central purchasing via the Free Tire Purchasing Initiative (FRI), the merchandise management system tiresoft 3 and the automatic replenishment control VMI. In addition to the classic tire service, many HMI partners are dedicated to the lucrative and high-margin vehicle service. Here too, our HMI partners with the "Trucks" and "Premio Tuning" areas have successful service modules at their disposal. HMI places particular value on the potential of each partner and the quality of its operations in order to increase the competitiveness of the group and that of each individual.
