It is difficult as an individual entrepreneur to adapt to the constantly changing conditions in order not to lose contact with the competition. It's good to be part of something bigger and have an organization like the GDHS behind you that deals intensively with the constantly changing circumstances, while you can concentrate on your actual core business. The workshop of the future at a glance The development of vehicles that communicate internally between their systems and use the connection to the global network externally poses completely new challenges for workshop operators. In addition, there is a fundamentally changing consumer behavior, which not only affects the tire industry, but has become commonplace today: today, between 80 and 90% of customers across all sectors get information in advance on the Internet and have specific product, service and price ideas when they are come to a shop or a store. It is therefore increasingly important for Goodyear Dunlop trading systems and their affiliated partners to be present online and not only with advertising, but also with an online shop. Because contact with new customers who order their goods and services via the web shops and book their appointments directly in the online appointment planner is a great opportunity to offer further products and services and to generate new regular customers from the visitors of the web shops.
