The company was founded in 2008 by the two owners Gerhard Steinko (GF) and the management consultant Alexander Wolf and expanded to one of the largest automotive glass networks in Germany with a good 600 partner companies (as of 2015). The partner companies of this system, which continues to grow very dynamically, are almost without exception master car dealers who have not only recognized the "Auto Glass" business area as an additional source of income, but also see themselves as specialists with a holistic understanding of the "Auto System". As members of a strong system, companies benefit from effective advertising measures, a central online billing system, insurance listing and wholesale purchasing conditions. The KS AUTOGLAS idea for car glass is an interesting and lucrative niche for the automotive market, but is dealt with on a large scale by specialists. KS AUTOGLAS has therefore taken on the task of directing this business back into the automotive business. KS AUTOGLAS offers its partners the necessary prerequisites: technology know-how, top purchase prices, insurance partners, marketing and customer acquisition. KS AUTOGLAS history 1992 KS AUTOGLAS Zentrum GmbH was founded by Gerhard Steinko. In 2002 he developed the idea of ​​the partner system with today's co-owner Alexander Wolf. In the first few years the network grew slowly but steadily and in 2008 KS Partnersystem GmbH was founded. KS has been a premium partner of many automotive insurance companies since 2009, and in 2010 a nationwide sales force network was established. 2013 is characterized by the introduction of a new accounting platform, ISO certification and the construction of an administration and training center in Bühl, which will be completed in spring 2014. The KS AUTOGLAS philosophy KS AUTOGLAS sees itself as a counterweight to chains such as CarGlass or A.T.U. and figuratively represents the cooperative idea: many small "Davids" against a large "Goliath"! KS AUTOGLAS is primarily a licenser for master car dealers to give you a significantly improved competitive position compared to pure auto glasses through its market presence as an auto glass specialist. KS AUTOGLAS attaches great importance to working at the highest quality level. Windows and accessories exclusively in OEM quality, ISO certification according to DIN9001: 2008 * in the automotive glass sector and constant further development of the system, but also fair and trusting interaction with each other are guarantors of success for KS. * TÜV certification according to DIN9001: 2008 for the scope of auto glass repair and auto glass replacement.
