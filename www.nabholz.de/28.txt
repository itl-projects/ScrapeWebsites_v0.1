To your offer INTELLIGENT TIRES IN THE TRACTOR AREA Like the high-performance area for cars, the tractor tires are developing in the direction of "intelligent tires". Not only tractors beyond 230PS or the heaviest harvesters require clever solutions in the agricultural sector. The requirements for traction, load-bearing capacity and soil protection are just as much a part of the specifications of the AS tire as cost-effectiveness. Large contact areas ensure low surface pressure and fewer traces due to the soil structure. These are just two of many factors that count off the road. But an AS tire has to do even more. Even on long road trips at a speed of 50 km / h, it must not be limp. The requirements on the field and on the road therefore demand top performance. Not only by the tire designers, but also by the service provider. We are prepared for it. With the product variety of strong brands.
