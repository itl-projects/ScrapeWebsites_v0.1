Approvals exist for a large number of motorcycles from European, Japanese and American production. Dunlop - manufacturer of premium tires, also for two-wheelers. Over 100 years of motorsport experience are key to transfer racing technology to high performance road tires. The extensive model range extends from racing and enduro tires to motocross and scooter tires. Well-known motorcycle manufacturers such as Harley-Davidson rely on Dunlop's performance and technologies for original equipment. "Grip and precision for the highest demands." Metzeler - The German manufacturer based in Munich specializes in motorcycle tires and stands for high quality through technological progress. In 1986 Metzeler was taken over by the Italian tire manufacturer Pirelli and has since been run as an independent brand. For the third time in a row, METZELER secured the top spot in the "Best Brand" readers' choice of the magazine MOTORRAD 2017.

Michelin motorcycle tires are tested and tested in the Michelin Power Research Team, the fastest testing laboratory in the world: This is how the latest innovations in racing flow into tires with road approval ... Pirelli - the name is not only known from Formula 1. Pirelli is also one of the absolute premium brands in the two-wheeler segment. The involvement in the FIM Superbike World Championship and the FIA ​​World Rally Championship is the basis for everyday tire technology from road, touring and enduro machines to modern scooters. Road tire range As soon as the bike rolls out of the garage, the tires are challenged. On the road, where most kilometers are driven in the course of a motorcycle life, they are the most important connection between the driver and the asphalt. Touring If you like to fly sporty and dynamic through the countryside on winding country roads, you cannot avoid the right touring tires. This type of tire is characterized by exceptional agility and manageability. Enduro Just like the versatile motorcycles, the enduro tires should be extremely flexible. Long durability and good grip on bumpy roads and sufficient stability on the road. Depending on individual requirements, the properties can be weighted differently. Racing Enormous speed and extreme corners - this is the terrain on which a racing tire has to move. Depending on the profile and construction, the race tires withstand remarkable forces and guarantee absolute precision and speed when negotiating winding courses. Scooters & Scooters Most scooters and scooters are a lot lighter than motorcycles. That is why the tires are constructed differently and there are other priorities. The focus is particularly on durability in all weather conditions, since the scooter is often used as an everyday vehicle. Quad quads are no longer just used on the street. The agile vehicles also play an important role in forestry and other areas. That is why the tires have to be tailored to the area of ​​application. Air pressure recommendation Most tire damage is caused or exacerbated by incorrect air pressure. In addition, the air pressure significantly influences the driving behavior of the motorcycle. The air pressure is prescribed by the vehicle manufacturer and can be found in the driver's manual and on the motorcycle (seat, swing arm). The air pressure must be set on the cold tire, as the air pressure also rises due to the temperature increase (it must not be reduced). The air pressure should be checked once a week. In the case of passenger operation, it is usually to be increased by 0.2 bar. Too low air pressure means excessive heating of the tire, which can lead to destruction. Excessive air pressure worsens driving behavior, driving comfort and changes the abrasion pattern. After checking the air, don't forget to screw the valve cap back on. If you want to find out the tire dimensions and ideal air pressure for your machine, we invite you to either browse through the Metzeler tire catalog or search the Dunlop conversion database. Approval for your machine Particularly with motorcycles, it is important to ensure that the tire dimensions and profiles entered in the vehicle documents are mounted on the prescribed wheel positions. For motorcycles that do not have a tied profile in the vehicle documents, it is possible to fit tires of a higher speed class if the desired version is only available in a higher speed class. In the case of tire and manufacturer-specific tire regulations, the registered version must always be fitted. This means that no tires may be fitted here that correspond in size and profile to the entered tire, but not the speed (e.g. V 270 instead of V 250). If tires are to be used, regardless of whether they are of the same size, type of construction or just a profile, the driver of the motorcycle must in any case request a certificate of approval from the relevant vehicle manufacturer. This certificate includes the entry in the letter by an expert (TÜV) as well as in the vehicle registration document at the registration office by the keeper.
