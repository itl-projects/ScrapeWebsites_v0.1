Quite a lot demands from the rubbers under the wheel arch. You can only be fully sure with the right material. Trust the best. The most important things you should know about tires can of course be learned from our specialist staff. Winter tires With ice and snow, you can only drive safely with the right winter tires. The safety of all drivers in the cold season depends on their condition, profile depth and quality. Trailer If the trunk is insufficient, a trailer can help. The tires are particularly challenged when transporting heavy loads. We have the right models for every trailer. Snow chains When slush and a steep climb meet, nothing works without the right iron helpers on the tires. With the right snow chains you fight your way up the highest mountain. Complete services Aquaplaning demands top performance from tires In everyday use, drivers repeatedly put their tires under enormous strain. Unconsciously and unintentionally, the wheels are subjected to extremely high loads in many situations. No matter whether extreme heat in summer or bitter cold in the winter months, as a driver you normally always rely on the performance of the rubbers. Among other things, it is crucial for the safety of all occupants. This makes the high importance that the tires should have quite clear. One scenario with which the tires can be confronted at any time and unexpectedly is so-called aquaplaning. A tire at 80km / h must displace up to 25 liters of water in a single second. Otherwise the tread would lose contact with the asphalt and the whole car would float on the road. This can lead to devastating accidents. To prevent this horror scenario, the driver has only two options. On the one hand, the speed must be adapted to the weather and road conditions. You can refer to the rule of thumb "maximum 70 km / h". In addition, the tires must be in a suitable condition, which means at least a remaining tread depth of 3mm. What does the forest ranger have in common with the Cayenne in the city? Four-wheel drive vehicles have become an integral part of our lives today. But you don't have to be a tire professional to know that the intended purpose defines the tire significantly. Sport utility vehicles - SUVs for short - have experienced a real boom in recent years. The large amount of space and the high seating position were important for the customers. Four-wheel drive gives additional safety - without question. However, if you compare commercial car tires with those for 4x4, they are characterized by a different design and special properties. There is a greater weight to be lifted as well as the forces with the higher center of gravity. Modern SUVs have large engines and can easily cope with high speeds. A pleasant rolling noise is just as important as optimal aquaplaning and braking properties. In addition to the tire size, the tread design and the rubber compound are of crucial importance. Above all, it is important to decide which terrain you will be on. A distinction is made between: Street terrain: primarily on the road, minimal terrain. Tires are visually similar to car tires, all terrain: designed for asphalt and light terrain. Mostly designed for higher loads. Mud Terrain: Predominant use in the field. Coarse-treaded profile, for high traction in mud and mud. Reinforced tire flanks to protect against cuts and tears.
