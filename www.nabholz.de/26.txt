My expectations were not extremely high - I just wanted to get to know the “car” better through theoretical and practical execution. When I arrived at the company, I was warmly welcomed by the branch's automotive master and given work clothes. Then the workshop manager's Opel Corsa started. The car had a damaged shock absorber, which is why we had to replace it, it was different than expected, I was allowed to help and had something to do. On the very first day I was shown how to replace a shock absorber, how to change brake discs and brake pads. During the week I also got to see some nice cars, including a Ferrari F360, which was there for wheel alignment. Even as a trainee, I was able to help very carefully - under guidance - when I think about the week in the Nabholz workshop, I have to say that I have learned a lot. The job of a car mechatronic engineer is not my dream job, but the internship was fully worth it for me to gain first experience and first insights into professional life. If I take one from the last five days with me, it is how perfectly the team looked after me as a "junior".
