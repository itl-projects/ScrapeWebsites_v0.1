Biker's brand favorites For the twelfth time, "Motorrad" magazine awarded the "Best Brand 2017" trophy based on a large reader survey as part of the "Motorcycle of the Year" election. The editors of Europe's largest motorcycle magazine asked 50,000 motorcyclists which brands offer particularly convincing products in the respective categories. Here are the top placements from the “two-wheel tires” area (for comparison, the values ​​from the previous year in brackets) 1. Metzeler 66.7% (66.9%) 2nd Michelin 55.9% (62.1%) 3rd Pirelli 48.2% (47.2%) 4th Continental 46.0% (38.1%) 5. Bridgestone 38.1% (41.4%) 6. Dunlop 28.0% (28.0%) Biker Tips Air Pressure Recommendation Most tire damage is caused or exacerbated by incorrect air pressure. In addition, the air pressure significantly influences the driving behavior of the motorcycle. The air pressure is prescribed by the vehicle manufacturer and can be found in the driver's manual and on the motorcycle (seat, swing arm). The air pressure must be set on the cold tire, as the air pressure also rises due to the temperature increase (it must not be reduced). The air pressure should be checked once a week. In the case of passenger operation, it is usually to be increased by 0.2 bar, too low air pressure can lead to destruction. Excessive air pressure worsens driving behavior, driving comfort and changes the abrasion pattern. Load capacity and speed The tire load capacity and the maximum speed are specified in the tire identification (vehicle registration line 20-23). The permissible axle loads (lines 14 and 15) must never be undercut. The maximum speed is determined by the speed code letter on the tire. Different mixtures The assembly of tires with special, particularly adhesive mixtures must be carried out on both wheel positions. Please discuss exceptional cases with your NABHOLZ tire specialist. Tire repairs on motorcycles Damage to a tire must always be checked by a specialist. We do not recommend repairing tires for safety reasons. The breakdown aids available on the market are only to be regarded as emergency aids. When using them, the instructions of the repair agent manufacturer must be observed. The insertion of an air hose to seal a damaged tire is prohibited. Tire storage The storage room for tires should be cool, dry, dark and moderately ventilated. Tires that are not mounted on rims must be stored upright. Fuels, lubricants, solvents and chemicals must not be stored in the same room. Terms and designation systems The dimension description of a tire is subject to clearly defined definitions. For example, this alphanumeric identifier gives you information about: 180/55 R 17 (73 W) 180 = tire width in (mm) 55 = cross-sectional ratio in% R = identifier for tire type (R = radial) 17 = rim diameter in inches 73 = load capacity Key figure W = speed symbol RECOMMENDATION FOR TIRE RUNNING In due to the production process, new tires have a smooth surface, the full adhesion of motorcycle tires is not yet guaranteed. Commercial tires require a break-in period of approx. 200 km with a moderate driving style. During the running-in period, the incline in the bends should be slowly increased, load changes, shifting or strong acceleration in the inclined position should be avoided. You should also avoid high-speed driving and performance measurements on test benches, because the rubber is given its final structure by the initial heating and subsequent cooling. In the spring / autumn, the break-in period increases depending on the weather due to colder temperatures. Only after this has the tire reached full grip. Code letters with associated speed The following letters indicate the maximum speed of the tire: B = 50 km / h C = 60 km / h D = 65km / h E = 70 km / h F = 80 km / h G = 90 km / h J = 100 km / h K = 110mh / h L = 120km / h M = 130km / h N = 140km / h P = 150km / h Q = 160km / h R = 170km / h S = 180km / h T = 190km / h U = 200km / h H = 210km / h V / VB = 240km / h W = Up to 270km / h ZR = Over 240km / h ASSEMBLY INSTRUCTIONS1. Inner tube type tires When installing new TT (= tubetype) tires, new air tubes must always be inserted. Since the old hoses have stretched, there is a risk of wrinkles when reused, which can tear the hoses while driving. 2. Tubeless tires When installing new TL (= tubeless) tires, it is recommended for safety reasons to use new valves. Since in extreme cases the centrifugal forces bend the valve by up to 90 ° when braking, accelerating, driving on the freeway, short valves must be used. In the dynamic state at speeds of over 200 km / h, centrifugal forces become so great that the spring preload and the internal pressure are no longer sufficient to keep the valve closed.
