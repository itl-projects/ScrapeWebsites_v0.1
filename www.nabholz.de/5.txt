At NABHOLZ you can rely on optimal service. Come to the experts. Wheel change / assembly of commercial vehicles Trucks and commercial vehicles drive on the road on special rubbers, because they have to withstand very different requirements than, for example, car tires. The change and installation are accordingly demanding. Wheel change / assembly of solid rubber & registration tires Due to their nature, solid rubber tires are extremely low-maintenance and resistant to impact and cut injuries, but trained personnel are required for assembly and replacement. Retreading When damaged, tires are often not yet ready for the garbage, but can be saved and refurbished with professional retreading. This alternative is also much cheaper. Fleet Check So that your fleet stays in motion, we come to your company premises. We check the tires of the entire vehicle fleet, correct the tire inflation pressure if necessary, measure the tread depth, examine tires, spare tires and rims for damage and wear - and provide you with a detailed work protocol. Wheel alignment We are the specialists for wheel alignment: On our state-of-the-art devices, we usually check and correct the setting values ​​of your axles more precisely than the manufacturer himself - and usually even cheaper - including setting. Lane adjustment The axle geometry is so sensitive even in your vehicle that it takes even the smallest curbs or a slight impact - in the truest sense of the word - "crooked". Therefore, the advice of the experts should be heeded: "Also take supposedly small bumps against the axis seriously and do not wait until costly consequential damage becomes noticeable." Oil and oil filters NABHOLZ's vehicle service uses only high-performance products from leading brands and also ensures that the used oil is disposed of in an environmentally friendly manner. An offer you shouldn't miss. Air conditioning service We take care of your wellbeing in the cockpit. The air conditioning service ensures that the temperature in the interior remains pleasant and that pollen and odors are excluded. Brakes If you now change your tires with us, we will always take a look at the brake system of your vehicle. If something seems to be wrong, we can repair it - almost in a jiffy. Professional and with original parts, of course. Come to the experts. Shock absorbers Damage to shock absorbers is very common. The tricky thing is that they usually creep in and are therefore difficult for the "normal" driver to recognize. Exhaust system Nothing is as annoying as a damaged exhaust. In addition to noise and odor nuisance, this can also result in lower engine output and higher petrol consumption. We replace the defective elements with original parts or inexpensive alternatives. Talk to us. Battery service A powerful car battery is essential, especially at the start of the cold season. With our service we check the condition of your battery for you and of course replace it if necessary. Season checks When the last snow has melted in spring and the first frost creeps over the streets in autumn, you should prepare your car for the upcoming season as a precaution. With the seasonal checks at NABHOLZ, your car is fit for ice and snow in winter and also the summer heat. Tie rods The task of the tie rod is to precisely transmit the driver's steering movements to the wheels. They connect the steering levers to the steering gear and should only be installed or replaced by specialists. Wiper blades In order not to lose sight of the situation behind the wheel, the wipers must always be in good condition. That is why the wiper blades should be regularly serviced and replaced. At NABHOLZ we take care of this service work. Accessories There is an almost infinite range of accessories and extras for everything to do with cars. Some are compulsory, others pure decoration.
