Wheel alignment and wheel alignment at Nabholz Wheel alignment and wheel alignment - NABHOLZ Reifen + Fahrwerk-Service keeps you on track! Whether wheel alignment or wheel alignment - this is the same service. Drivers know the problem only too well: The car pulls to the left, the driver has to intervene all the time. Another indication to visit a workshop as quickly as possible: The tires have worn significantly more on one side than on the other side. Your car can react sensitively to even the smallest deviations, i.e. a misaligned lane. The lifespan of the car and especially your tires is significantly reduced. Incorrectly set track leads to increased wear. There are many negative consequences of an incorrectly set track. There is a risk of increased wear of the vehicle, but in particular also increased rolling resistance and thus higher fuel consumption. Our NABHOLZ experts recommend that you check the axle geometry once a year. In addition to buying new tires, wheel alignment is particularly useful. So you can be sure that the new tires will not have an uneven profile loss within a very short time. The NABHOLZ vehicle workshop quickly recognizes the problem. The vehicle is measured using a state-of-the-art system, and small deviations in the axle geometry are already displayed. The experts in our vehicle workshop immediately take on the task of adjusting the track. We make sure that your car runs straight and quietly again with just a few simple steps at a low price. Make an appointment right now and do something good for your chassis! Our vehicle workshops of the NABHOLZ branches are available to you at any time. NABHOLZ experts take care of the adjustment. If you have now decided on wheel alignment, pay careful attention to the selection of the right workshop. Only trained professionals from the tire or automotive industry should set the track. Otherwise there are further repairs and high follow-up costs. Our competent NABHOLZ workshop team is always at your disposal. We make sure that your axle is perfectly adjusted and your wheels are running straight. The wheel alignment is not expensive and has a big effect: the next tire change and the next visit to the car workshop can be delayed! Profiles that are worn on one side due to an adjusted track can now be excluded. The price for adjusting the axis is lower than you would think. The price in the car dealership often discourages. Adjustment at specialist dealers is not that expensive. New adjustment takes about an hour. Adjusting your track is no problem in all NABHOLZ branches and we usually do it within an hour. With older cars this can sometimes take a little longer because the tie rod is rusted so hard that the mechanics need more time. In these cases we discuss the procedure and possible additional costs with you. As a rule, however, our employees are able to measure and correctly adjust almost all vehicles thanks to electronic support. Wheel alignment We are the specialists for wheel alignment: On our state-of-the-art devices, we usually check and correct the setting values ​​of your axles more precisely than the manufacturer himself - and usually even cheaper - including setting. Axle and lane adjustment The axle geometry is so sensitive even in your vehicle that it takes even the smallest curbs or a slight impact - in the truest sense of the word - "crooked". Therefore, the advice of the experts should be heeded: "Also take supposedly small bumps against the axis seriously and do not wait until costly consequential damage becomes noticeable." Inspection / Service Being on the road with a good feeling - that is exactly what we can offer you through our inspection and services. We carry out inspections on your car according to the manufacturer's instructions.
