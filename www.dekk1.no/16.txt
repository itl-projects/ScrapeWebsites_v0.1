Then you have to choose the right tire. Tires1 is a specialist retail chain that focuses on quality tires and carries the well-known tire brands. At Deck1 you can rest assured that we know which winter tires are best for you and your car. In our stores you will find qualified personnel who can tell you which winter tires are best for your particular car. This is often more important than tire tests taken on a general basis. We know your car and will give you the right advice. If you've read a tire test in a weekly magazine or newspaper, test winners may not be the right fit for your car. Ask us why are good winter tires so important? The tires are the only thing that connects you and your car to the ground. And did you know that the part of a normal car tire that is in contact with the surface at all times is not much larger than a palm? This means that a few square inches of rubber helps determine the fate of you and your fellow passengers.

There are huge differences in road grip and durability between the various tire marks of winter tires. Someone should never be on the road. Every year, tires are tested in several independent tire tests, where the well-known brands always come out the best. But some winter tires on the market are so dangerous and miserable that they end up with 0 out of 100 achievable points! Should one choose studded tires or studded tires?
