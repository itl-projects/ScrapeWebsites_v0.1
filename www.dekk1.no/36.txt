Since 1997, Vredestein has worked closely with world-renowned Italian designer Giorgetto Giugiaro and his company Giugiaro Design.

The collaboration has led Vredestein to become a leader in its niche, with safety and design as the most important elements. International tire tests have repeatedly confirmed that Vredestein not only has a sensational design, but that the tires are also top notch in terms of performance.
