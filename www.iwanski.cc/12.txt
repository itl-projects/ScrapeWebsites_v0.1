Do your employees carry PSAgA? Do you have to leave the platform lift at height? Then your employees need a PSAgA instruction (PSAgA = personal protective equipment against falls) according to the PSA usage regulation (PSA-BV)! Getting out of the height of the aerial work platform is almost commonplace, even though it is initially prohibited. This process poses a considerable risk for the person who gets out! In many cases, accidents happen because the employees are not trained to climb the heights and work under the risk of falling. With qualified user training, operators are qualified to climb the heights - and legally! Therefore: SYSTEM-CARD users PSAgA You need the SYSTEM-CARD users PSAgA! Training is given in theory and practice SYSTEM-CARD in German-English version for presentation abroad according to legal requirements PSA BV (PSA usage regulation) according to professional association guidelines DGUV regulation 112-198 Leaving the work platform cage at height: Risk assessment Measures and requirements Video explanation Further information on personal protective equipment against falls is explained to you in the following videos: Fitting the safety harness The fall arrester The fall arrester Content of the training: Definition of PPE: Categories and types of personal protective equipment (against falls) Risk assessment: operational planning to minimize exposure, consideration of alternative possible uses, risks Legal aspects ArbSchG, BetrSichV, PSA-BV, DGUV regulation 112-198 (BGR 198), BGI 826, BGI 5164 Technique: types and priorities of security systems, construction + components PSAgA, attachment points, fall physics and material science Handling / operation: putting on and missing PSA, correct attachment, procedure when crossing the platform, behavior in an emergency, self-experience hanging in PSA under controlled conditions Height exit: exit from the work platform in working position. Procedure, use of suitable PPE and attachment points Further information on the subject of PPE personal protective equipment (PPE) must be used in all activities which, due to their nature, cause health damage or injuries and which cannot be avoided by other measures (organizational or technical). In addition to the organizational and technical measures, the personal measures (PPE and instruction) are added to the traditional measures for health protection and occupational safety. However, the organizational and technical measures are preferred. Personal protective equipment is used in business as well as in rescue facilities and in the Bundeswehr or the police. But PPE are also indispensable aids in the sport and leisure sector (e.g. protective helmet, safety harness, backpack). You must comply with the basic provisions of Annex II to Directive 89/686 / EEC (1). Harmonized standards, which have been drawn up by the EU Commission, specify clear requirements for the individual items of equipment. Further information on the subject of PSAgA Personal protective equipment against falls (PSAgA) is also a set of equipment that insured persons must use if there is a risk of falling if there is no organizational or technical fall protection system. The employees to be secured must have completed an instruction with an examination. The employees must also undergo a preventive occupational medical examination (G41.0). The employers' liability insurance associations draw up guidelines stating the height of the fall from which an obligation to provide security is required. The protective equipment consists of a fall arrest and holding system. The fall arrest system is designed to safely catch the falling person and keep the body safe in the event of a fall. The holding system must ensure that the activity can be carried out with minimal stress and danger. The eventuality of a crash must be excluded.
