In addition to wheel alignment, it is also necessary to balance the wheels each time the tire is changed for optimal straight-line running and thus even tire wear, because an unbalanced tire can lead to reduced contact with the road. At higher speeds, this can result in incorrect steering movements. When balancing, the rolling properties of the complete wheel are first checked by our specialists before mounting. If the measuring devices indicate an imbalance, we will correct them with the help of balancing weights on the rim. The center of gravity of the wheel is again on the axis of rotation and the tire runs smoothly. The storage of unused summer or winter tires not only takes up a lot of space, the wrong storage can also lead to a significant loss of quality or even unusability. For this reason, we offer you the professional storage of your dismantled tires in our rooms.
