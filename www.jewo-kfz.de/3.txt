Air conditioning service | JeWo GmbH KFZ-Reparatur + Lackierung 0431-680490 WelcomeWorkshopServicesAxis measurementVehicle diagnosticsInspectionBody workAir conditioning servicePaintingTire serviceContact & arrival Professional maintenance of your air conditioning systemYour air conditioning system in the vehicle is no longer performing at its full capacity or is it giving off bad smells? In most cases, this is due to a lack of maintenance and care. In the course of years of use, air conditioning systems lose coolant due to natural shrinkage, which leads to a drop in performance. Therefore, the coolant should be replaced every 2 to 3 years. If the air conditioning system has not been used for a long period of time, this can lead to brittle seals and thus leakages. With the help of a contrast agent, we make them visible and remove the defect immediately.
