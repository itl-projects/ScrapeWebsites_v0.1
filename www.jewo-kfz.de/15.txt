Depending on the extent, we eliminate these defects with minimal effort. In this way we avoid unnecessary replacement of damaged body parts and thus reduce the time and costs involved. We also repair parking damage such as dents or scratches in the vehicle paint quickly and reliably, without the need to repaint the relevant vehicle parts. Before we start with the repair work, we carry out a detailed damage analysis and discuss with you which body work is necessary and which should actually be carried out. Of course, we only use original parts from your vehicle manufacturer. Our expert paint team ensures that the original paint is as close as possible so that the damage can hardly be recognized after our repair work.
