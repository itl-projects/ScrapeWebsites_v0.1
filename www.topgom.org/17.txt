From this date, drivers have a month to restore the summer equipment of the vehicle, up to the deadline set for May 15, 2017. After this deadline, all those who have not replaced winter tires, identifiable as M + S tires , may face administrative sanctions. With the checks from May until next October, the fines will be quantifiable from 422 to 1,695 euros, with possible withdrawal of the registration certificate and the obligation to visit and test at the nearest headquarters of the Civil Motorization. Exemption from the obligation to change summer-winter tires There is however a small exception regarding the obligation to install summer tires. The exemption, in this case, is applicable only in the case the speed code - the maximum speed at which a tire can travel - of the tires fitted is equal to or higher than that indicated in the vehicle manual under "Tires". In any case, it is always advisable to promptly replace the tires according to the season or, if necessary, to have a set of 4-season tires valid throughout the year. Prev Next Home Home.
