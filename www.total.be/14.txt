Home My vehicle Engine oils Engine oils Engine oil is a fluid of mineral or synthetic origin which has an essential lubrication role for the various moving parts of the engine, subject to wear. By using quality engine oil, you not only protect your engine more effectively, but you also help reduce your impact on the environment. Find here the range of TOTAL and ELF lubricants, adapted to all needs, and discover our advice on maintenance, oil level control and oil change. Which oil to choose? Find our full range of engine oils for all needs and for all makes of vehicles. What oil? Auto Tips Advice and tips for maintaining your car properly. Car advice Motorcycle advice Advice and tips for all types of 2 wheels. Motorcycle advice The Total TOTAL brand is the name of the Group. It evokes globality and commitment. It has identical meaning and pronunciation in many languages ​​around the world. The Total brand The Elf brand The ELF brand has existed for over 40 years. ELF lubricants maintain an image of modernity and technology. The Elf brand In an emergency My vehicle Finding oil Can I put diesel engine oil in a petrol engine and vice versa? The lubrication requirements of a gasoline engine are different from those of a diesel engine. When developing lubricants, they pass a certain number of tests, some common to diesel and petrol engines, others specific, which will characterize their performance. This will result in the allocation of API, ACEA / CCMC specifications. These specifications characterize the acceptable functioning of the lubricant in each of the types of petrol or diesel engine. Lubricants for 4-stroke engines therefore mostly meet petrol and diesel specifications. For example, an API SJ / CF lubricant has the SJ petrol specification and the CF diesel specification. However, this does not necessarily mean that it will have the same performance in a petrol engine as in a diesel engine. This is why we have developed specialized ranges, optimized either for petrol or for diesel. Can I add additives to the oil? The composition of an oil is based on the balance of additives that contribute, among other things, to the detergent, dispersant, antioxidant, anti-corrosion, and anti-wear characteristics. Adding additional additives can unbalance the oil and decrease its performance. Which lubricant should be used in a turbo-compressor vehicle? In order to carry out lubrication and the needs of the turbo-compressor cooling system, the lubricant must meet certain criteria very strictly. The circuit reaches a very high temperature due to the proximity of the exhaust gases. The lubricant must lubricate the circuit continuously otherwise the high temperatures would be permanently damaging and the temperature would very quickly reach very high levels. These conditions mean that the lubricant must offer considerable detergency property, significant resistance to oxidation and the formation of deposits, and above all very high thermal stability. The use of synthetic technology lubricant is the best recommendation here. What should I do with my drain oil? Throw it back into the garden? The law forbids you! Used oils are not very biodegradable, their discharge into the environment constitutes a significant risk for the environment. Today, more than 90% of used motor oils are collected and processed, but we can do better. Used oils must be deposited in the right place: for more information, please contact the municipal cleaning service or the recycling center. Can I store my oil? Can it deteriorate? In unopened cans stored frost-free, protected from light and humidity and at temperatures below 50 ° C, your oil retains all its qualities, it can be stored for 3 years. If the packaging has been "closed" immediately after use, having taken care not to have polluted it (by dust, particles, solvents, water or other), the storage period is one year. What packaging and for what purpose? If you carry out your own emptying, you need a 5 liter canister, knowing that the average capacity of a sump is 4.5 liters. If it is a question of topping up while waiting for the next emptying, the 1 liter canister meets your needs: it is practical, easy to use and less expensive. There are also lots including a 5 liter and a 1 liter container that will meet all your needs. Can we change viscosity from one drain to another? Yes, it is possible to change viscosity provided that you comply with the manufacturer's requirements. The choice of viscosity will depend on the manufacturer's requirements as well as the conditions of use of the vehicle, the environment and climatic conditions. What is the draining frequency? The periodicity indicated by the manufacturer must be adjusted according to: - the lubricant used; - the use of the vehicle (road, city, highway); - thermal and mechanical constraints. Never drive below the minimum level. Below, there is not enough oil, resulting in faster circulation of the fluid and accelerated wear of the oil. It is recommended to check the level regularly every 1000 km and more especially before a long journey. Why drain it? Draining is an essential operation to keep a vehicle in good condition: - because the lubricant is charged with particles of internal and external pollution (carbonaceous materials, particles of wearing metals); - because the oil is degraded by: dilution of water and fuel, oxidation, consumption of its additives, shearing. Are all lubricants suitable for vehicles fitted with catalytic converters? The answer is clear and clear: NO. The function of the particle filters is to trap the particles, this in order to avoid the polluting missions which are found in the exhaust gases. The additives used in the manufacture of lubricants contain elements such as sulfur, sulphate ash and phosphorus, which can affect the functioning of the filter. Latest generation lubricants (meeting at least the ACEA categories C1, C2, C3 or C4) are therefore recommended because of their formulation which means that they contain latest generation additives and that they are in this way less harmful for particulate filters. What are the advantages of a multigrade oil? A multigrade oil is an oil whose properties have been strengthened so as to decrease the evolution of its viscosity with temperature. Thus, a multigrade oil will be more fluid at low temperature and thicker at high temperature than a monograde oil. Concretely, this translates as follows: when the vehicle is stationary (for several hours), all of the engine oil goes down into the crankcase so that, when starting, it takes a certain time ( a few microseconds) before the oil again reaches all parts of the engine to be lubricated. As a multigrade oil is more fluid at low temperatures, it reaches the different elements of the engine faster than a monograde oil, thus reducing wear at start-up. multigrade oils generally allow fuel savings of around 1.5% 3% compared to monograde oils. A multigrade oil offers better protection of engines at low and high temperatures than a monograde oil insofar as it retains an optimal viscosity over the operating temperature range of the engine. What are the benefits of quality oil? A good quality oil provides many advantages to the motorist: - easier cold starting and reduced wear (20 to 30% of engine wear is observed between starting and optimal engine warm-up); - longer engine life; - fuel economy thanks to a reduction in friction of moving parts and better engine performance; - moving parts and better engine performance. How to evaluate the performance of a lubricant? Many indications appear on the labels of the products. They inform you about the performance of the lubricant. The ACEA performances, as well as the manufacturer's approvals are indicated and allow you to choose the lubricant best suited to your vehicle. What is the role of a lubricant? If you own a vehicle, you no doubt know that the lubricant is essential for the proper functioning of your engine to: - cool the hot areas of the engine and moving parts; - clean and protect the engine parts; - reduce friction, that is to say facilitate the setting in motion of all the parts of the engine whatever the atmospheric conditions; - protect the internal surfaces of the engine against corrosion. Additives also bring their contribution, in particular with detergent and dispersant additives, additives fighting against humidity and corrosion. Is it normal to top up with oil? To avoid any incident, it is recommended to check the engine oil level regularly. It is indeed normal for a small part of the oil circulating in the engine to be burned (an engine in good condition can consume between 0.2 and 0.5 liters of oil every 1000 km). In no way can successive additions of oil replace a drain. So, although it is normal for an engine to consume a reduced amount of oil compensated by top-ups between changes, too high top-ups can reveal a problem of various origins: unsuitable lubricant: too fluid, too volatile or degraded ; driver's behavior; mechanical condition of the engine; weather conditions. What are the possible causes of a drop in oil pressure? During normal operation of a vehicle, oil plays an important role in the seal between the combustion chamber and the crankcase. The oil pressure gauge then reveals the quality of this seal. An abnormal drop in oil pressure can be explained either by a drop in viscosity of the engine oil due to dilution by fuel (problem of injectors or use at low load ...) or simply by the lack of oil in the lubrication system (due to an oil leak, or to excessive oil consumption, or to a failure of the pump causing the circulation of the oil), or even to wear of mechanical parts. Can I put car engine oil in my motorcycle? No, because the 4-stroke engines of motorcycles do not have the same operating conditions as those of automobiles (higher speeds and engine temperatures). The engine lubricant can also be used to lubricate the gears of the gearbox and the clutch, thus requiring formulation of the oil with extreme pressure additives. On the other hand, the lubricants used in automobiles contain detergent / dispersant additives with high ash contents. In a motorcycle engine, they will induce the formation of deposits at the exhaust valves and on the piston heads which can cause valve burnout or perforation of the pistons. Can I mix two different types of oil? A lubricant is always optimized to meet the requirements of international classifications (API, ACEA). However, there are many ways to formulate this type of lubricant. Mixing two oils with equivalent characteristics will not be a problem, but the final performance cannot be guaranteed. All oils on the market (petrol or diesel engine, mineral or synthetic) are miscible with each other. However, a mixture of two different qualities of oil can only lower the superior quality. Can I put the same oil in my gearbox as in my engine? The answer to this question depends on the technology used. Indeed, if certain technologies allow the use of the same lubricant in the engine and the gearbox, new vehicles require the use of specific products. The vehicle manufacturer's recommendation should be followed. Why do we have to pay a "VALORLUB" contribution? Valorlub is involved in the costs occasioned by the collection and treatment of used oils in container parks and companies. Valorlub must also achieve the objectives set by the legislator (maximum collection, priority for regeneration and reuse, etc.); this is why this organization is also responsible for educating users about the behavior to adopt in terms of used oils. To finance this activity, producers and importers of oils pay an annual contribution to Valorlub. This contribution is calculated according to the quantities and types of oils they put on the Belgian market. How are used oils treated? There are several methods for treating used oils: Reuse as oils (reprocessing of used oils into reusable oils); Refining: treatment of used oils in a reusable material as oil in refineries; Use as fuel in a blast furnace; ...
