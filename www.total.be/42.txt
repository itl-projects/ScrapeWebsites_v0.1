Total Excellium for petrol and diesel vehicles Home My service station Fuels at the station Fuels Total Excellium for petrol and diesel vehicles TOTAL EXCELLIUM is a concentrate of technology which allows you to better protect your engine, up to 93% less fouling in your engine. A clean engine lasts longer, has a positive effect on your fuel consumption and reduces polluting emissions. Day after day, the engines can get dirty and their performance limited due to the accumulation of deposits affecting sensitive parts. TOTAL EXCELLIUM fuels incorporate new detergents that clean and keep essential engine components clean (injectors and intake valves). TOTAL EXCELLIUM, a new generation of fuels that clean your engine and protect it durably to make it more efficient, more economical and less polluting. * A clean engine consumes less * A clogged engine can increase your fuel consumption, that's why it is essential to keep it clean to maintain its effectiveness. The combination of detergent and friction-reducing technologies can reduce your fuel consumption. Why has the TOTAL EXCELLIUM fuel formula changed? Vehicles have evolved considerably to meet the constraints of pollution control standards (in particular the Euro 6 standard). New engines are therefore increasingly demanding on fuel (high temperature and pressure): The injectors are the key elements of diesel engines and they must be kept clean throughout the life of the vehicle in order to maintain engine performance. With the arrival of direct petrol injection systems, it is necessary to preserve the sensitive parts that are the injectors on these new engines. Petrol engines with indirect injection continue their development and new constraints may appear with variable valve lift technologies. Stop & start and hybrid vehicles are more and more numerous and these new technologies can be more sensitive to fouling. A fuel must respond as efficiently to the needs of all engines, whether new or older technologies. Engine cleanliness, what exactly is it? For petrol engines: TOTAL EXCELLIUM LEAD FREE 98 allows up to 99% (1) of fouling of the intake valve fouling of indirect injection engines. It keeps the intake system clean. It cleans up to 90% (2) of existing dirt on the intake valves. TOTAL EXCELLIUM LEAD FREE 98 prevents up to 79% (3) of fouling of injectors in direct injection engines. It can clean up to 51% (3) of fouling on the injectors. For diesel engines: TOTAL EXCELLIUM DIESEL avoids up to 93% (4) of fouling of the injectors. It can clean up to 45% (4) of existing dirt from the second tank. TOTAL EXCELLIUM DIESEL protects the injectors of newer and older engines against all types of fouling (5). By giving the fuel better filterability, TOTAL EXCELLIUM DIESEL helps protect the diesel filter from premature soiling. How can a fuel maintain engine performance over time? Regular use of TOTAL EXCELLIUM fuels will keep the injection system and engine valves clean. For petrol: by keeping the intake system of your engine clean, TOTAL EXCELLIUM 98 allows you to maintain an excellent quality of air / fuel mixture and therefore the performance of your engine throughout its life. For Diesel: TOTAL EXCELLIUM DIESEL allows you to maintain the power of your engine over time thanks to the preservation of the injectors against all forms of deposits. In the case of direct injection diesel engines, its use can restore engine power in just 6 hours (6). In addition, TOTAL EXCELLIUM fuels protect metal parts against corrosion linked to the presence of water (relating to condensation, rain, spray, etc.) which could damage certain parts of your engine's fuel system. They also contain molecules capable of limiting friction between metallic parts, thus reducing the risk of wear on sensitive parts of your engine. Your engine will take you further, longer. And the reduction in consumption in all this? A clogged engine can increase your vehicle’s fuel consumption, which is why keeping it clean is essential to maintaining efficiency. The combination of detergent, friction-reducing and combustion-enhancing technologies (for diesel engines only) reduces the fuel consumption of your engine. Pollutant emissions are reduced for all products in the TOTAL EXCELLIUM range? Indeed, whether for TOTAL EXCELLIUM LEAD FREE 98 or TOTAL EXCELLIUM Diesel, CO2 emissions are directly reduced thanks to the reduction in consumption. The use of TOTAL EXCELLIUM DIESEL has reduced carbon monoxide and cold unburned hydrocarbon emissions from several vehicles by an average of 22% from the first refueling. Reductions of up to 37% in carbon monoxide (CO) and up to 39% in unburned hydrocarbons (HC) have been reported (7). 1) Compared to a fuel not specifically additive, tests carried out in July 2013 on an indirect injection engine on the test bench according to the CEC F-05-93 reference method. The results may vary depending on the type of vehicle 2) Compared to a fuel that is not specifically additive, tests carried out by an external body in August 2013 on an engine with indirect injection on the test bench according to the CEC F-05- reference method 93. Results may vary depending on the type of vehicle. 3) Compared to a fuel that is not specifically additive, tests carried out in July 2013 on a direct injection engine on the test bench according to a method originating from the Total Research Center. Results may vary depending on the type of vehicle 4) Compared to a fuel that is not specifically additive, tests carried out in September 2013 on an engine with indirect injection at the test bench according to the CEC F-23-A-01 reference method. The results may vary depending on the type of vehicle 5) Compared to a fuel that is not specifically additive, several tests were carried out: tests carried out in September and October 2013 on a direct injection engine on the test bench according to the CEC reference method F-98-08 and test carried out in September 2013 using a method from the Total Research Center. Results may vary depending on the type of vehicle. 6) Compared to a fuel which is not specifically additive, test carried out in September and October 2013 on a direct injection engine on the test bench according to the CEC F-98-08 reference method The results may vary depending on the type of vehicle 7 ) Compared to a fuel that is not specifically additive, test carried out in 2014 on several vehicles on a dynamometer according to the Artemis cycle (representative of an average real run) with analysis of the results from the urban phase. Results may vary depending on the type of vehicle. The Total fuel range offers superior fuels at its service stations. TOTAL EXCELLIUM, Diesel and petrol fuels are the result of TOTAL know-how.
