Aviation Our products Home Professionals Aviation Aviation products Aircraft fuel for general aviation Total offers its three high-end aircraft fuels: JET A1 For commercial aviation: For your turbine engine tests and trials, Total offers you its aviation fuel. JET A-1 is a kerosene fuel suitable for most jet aircraft. It meets stringent international requirements, including the latest version of the British standard DEF STAN 91-91, ASTM D1655, and the NATO specification F-35. It has a flash point above 38 ºC (100 ºF) and a maximum freezing point of -47 ºC. It can also be used in general aviation for diesel powered aircraft. These specifications are reviewed periodically. Total adds a few special features which strengthen the quality of this aviation fuel, by providing full traceability from the refinery to the aircraft wing. Total is also a member of the JIG (Joint Inspection Group). Avgas 100 LL: The AVGAS 100 LL is an aviation gasoline specially designed for airplanes with piston engines. It is a particular blend with a high performance index. Its color is blue. The AVGAS 100 LL is identified in aerodrome distribution stations by its label in white letters on a red background. This strong identification is intended to avoid any risk of confusion or "misfueling" with the JET A-1, in white letters on a black background. Strict specifications: Total's AVGAS 100 LL meets the specifications of two major international references: ASTM D910 and Def Stan 91-90. "100" represents the Octane Aviation Index, substantially equal to the Octane Engine Index as for cars (MON). "LL" is the abbreviation for "Low Lead". Its aviation octane index in rich mixture, called "Performance Index", is 130 minimum. Constant quality control: International specifications are updated regularly. Total adds certain specificities which reinforce the quality of this aviation fuel. Deliveries tailored to specific needs: Total's AVGAS 100 LL is available in more than 50 countries around the world. Avgas UL 91: Because freedom to fly should not be at the expense of safety. AVGAS UL 91 is a lead-free aviation gasoline specially designed for ultra-light aircraft. Authorized by EASA (European Aviation Safety Agency), it meets the standards of ASTM International (American Society for Testing and Material), which defines the standards used worldwide to guarantee and improve the quality of fuels, increase the product safety and ensuring transparency for consumers. The AVGAS UL 91 thus benefits from all the controls associated with aviation fuels. Total is the first oil company to offer aviation gasoline that meets the ASTM D7547 standard. Total's AVGAS UL 91 guarantees you: a total absence of ethanol but also of ethers and other alcohols, harmful to certain aircraft components (seals, hoses, carburetors, etc.), consistent "aviation" quality of the product thanks to strict controls, carried out in accordance with the procedures in force, an absence of additives not approved for aviation, safer aviation practice. A better preserved environment. AVGAS UL 91 does not contain lead. Less polluting emissions into the atmosphere is more pleasure in flight.
