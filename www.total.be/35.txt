In this regard, beyond just washing, having your vehicle serviced by professionals is the best option. What are the elements checked during the maintenance of his car? It's inevitable: some parts of your car wear out as you use them. This is the case for brake disks and pads, tires, etc. In addition, fluids in your vehicle, such as engine oil, become dirty and need to be replaced frequently. Often, however, a distinction is made between “small” and “large” maintenance: every 15,000 km, or each year, the mechanic checks and, if necessary, replaces the brakes as well as the engine oil, checks the efficiency. of the battery as well as the coolant; every 30,000 km, the mechanic who performs the maintenance will also replace the air and pollen filters as well as any spark plugs that may be defective. He will also check the tires, shock absorbers and exhaust. The control of these various elements must imperatively be carried out by an informed professional. In addition, the lubricants and other products used during maintenance must be of high quality and chosen appropriately to guarantee the proper functioning of your vehicle.
