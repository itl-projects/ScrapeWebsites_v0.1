My delivery of pellets Home My house Heating with pellets My delivery of pellets Whether you choose wood pellets in bulk or in bags, TOTAL distributors carry out your delivery of pellets with great care. With TOTAL, your delivery of pellets can be carried out in three ways: in bulk; in bags per pallet; in bags, by yourself. Bulk pellets delivery After placing an order with your supplier, the bulk pellets are transported to your home by a specific truck capable of blowing the wood pellets through a pipe to your reserve. As with fuel oil delivery, the delivery of pellets requires some precautions. The truck should therefore have easy access to your filling opening. Ideally, this should be located on an exterior wall of your home. To avoid damaging the pellets during blowing and to preserve all their properties, it is also recommended to limit the distance from the pipes connecting the truck to the reserve (30 meters maximum), avoid bends as well as excessive deviations from height. Do not hesitate to ask your boiler installer or your pellet distributor for advice. State-of-the-art technology for the delivery of bulk pellets In order to provide you with optimal service, TOTAL pellets distributors rely on experienced deliverers. The latter have trucks fitted with technologies specially designed for the delivery of pellets. Thanks to an air-pellet mixer system, the wood pellets are blown in a permanent flow, which prevents the clogging of the pipes and prevents the appearance of fines. The quality of your pellets is therefore completely preserved during delivery. Why is it important to choose pellets with a low level of fines? Fines are small particles from wood processing and transport operations. They can foul your boiler, limit its efficiency and cause malfunctions if they are too large. Pellet delivery by pallet Like bulk pellets, wood pellets in bags can be delivered to you by pallet, directly to your home. You can choose between pallets comprising: 102 bags of 10 kg, or 1.02 tonnes of pellets per pallet; 65 bags of 15 kg, or 975 kg of pellets per pallet. As far as possible, using an on-board trolley or a pallet truck, the delivery person will arrange the pallet at your place of storage of the pellets, so that you will have no manipulation to carry out. Pellets removal in bags Pellets bags, 10 or 15 kg, can also be removed directly by you, whether in some shops but also within our petrol stations and ProxiDrive for the region of Hainaut and Liège.
