Regular inspections increase the safety, reliability and economy of your vehicle, contribute to value retention and thus protect your wallet. New car inspection according to manufacturer specifications According to the EU Block Exemption Regulation (GMO), maintenance and repair work on new cars no longer has to be carried out in the manufacturer's authorized workshops. This means that you can have your vehicle inspected, repaired and serviced in a free workshop even during the warranty period without losing any warranty claims. We use original branded spare parts and strictly adhere to the manufacturer's specifications when servicing and inspecting your vehicle. We thus meet all the requirements to maintain your vehicle safely, reliably and cheaply without loss of warranty claims. Services You can find an overview of our range of services here.
