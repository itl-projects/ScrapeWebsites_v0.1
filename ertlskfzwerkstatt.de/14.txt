As avowed classic car fans, we love the challenge that a classic car and the classic car service entail. We offer our customers a comprehensive range of services, from repairs and service to the repair of classic cars. Our diverse customers appreciate our commitment in the procurement of rare spare parts up to the high-quality execution of demanding repairs. A restoration can have very different goals. One customer wants the vehicle to be “as new as possible”, the other wants to keep the car as a reliable and, above all, traffic-safe vehicle while maintaining the age-related “patina”. The goals will be discussed with you in detail and recorded in a plan. This restoration plan lists the work to be carried out. We will inform you promptly about their course and the progress of the restoration. Services You can find an overview of our range of services here.
