A CAPITAL TO PRESERVE. THE BETTER IT WILL BE MAINTAINED THE MORE IT WILL LAST OVER TIME, BODY INCLUDED. PAINT: it is a protective and decorative coating which contributes to the quality of your car. When a splinter of paint or a crack appears, it is necessary to intervene before the oxidation does not spread over a too large surface and does not eat away at the sheet metal. ATTENTION: there are 3 main areas to watch: - The rocker panels , the grille, the hood and the wheel arches: you will find rust caused by the projection of gravel - The wings and the sides of doors: you will find small bumps, scuff marks and light shocks caused by negligence from other users (impact from other car doors, scratching of carts, vandalism, etc.) - The tops of the doors, the hood and the top of the boot: there are rust spots due to the natural aging of the vehicle. WIPER BLADES: These are the tools that allow you to clear the windshield for better visibility on the road. It is therefore essential that they are in good condition. Unfortunately they wear out through friction on the windshield or on snow and ice. They are deformed by temperature variations. Finally, they age, harden and crack under the action of ultraviolet rays. THE WINDSHIELD: this is your first protection and your window to see the road. Its maintenance is therefore more than important. But a slight impact can quickly degenerate. So don't wait for it to get worse. Resin-type materials can repair impacts smaller than a € 2 coin. PLEASE NOTE: this impact must be outside the field of vision, otherwise the windshield must be replaced! WHAT TO DO? Ask for the advice of a Precisium professional so that he can control your vehicle! AND… Wash your car regularly with appropriate products. Avoid washing in direct sunlight. Use water that is rather cold or lukewarm. Do not scrape dirt off bodywork but wait for it to dry and remove with a wet sponge. Wipe after washing. Remember to wash the rims to remove dust from the brake pads. Change your windshield wipers once a year. Repair your windshield before 'an impact does not degenerate.
