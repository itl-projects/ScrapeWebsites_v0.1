Dear customers, Despite the difficult situation in which we have all found ourselves, and meeting the need for continuity of supply, we would like to ensure that we will make every effort to keep your vehicles in motion. We are prepared and properly equipped so that you can safely use our services. Welcome to our services. Please be advised that as part of preventive measures we have introduced obligatory temperature measurement for all persons (employees, clients, suppliers) entering and entering the Intruck premises. The measurement is made at the entry barrier by a security guard. Please be advised that from May 1, 2020 for a period of 3 months we are introducing a limited amount of working time. This results in a new schedule of service hours: Monday 8: 00-17: 00 Tuesday-Friday 8: 00-14: 00 break 15: 00-21: 00 Saturday 8: 00-15: 00 In order to disinfect and exchange employees on Tuesday - Friday, we introduce a break between 14:00 and 15:00. This is to minimize the number of employees remaining on the site at the same time. About the company INTRUCK Intruck Sp. z o.o. is an authorized service center for Volvo and Renault Trucks trucks in central Poland. The company started its operations on March 1, 2004, in accordance with the agreement concluded with Volvo Polska Sp. z o.o. Under this agreement, the company took over the service activities previously carried out by Volvo Polska in Warsaw and Radom, and thus continues to sell service and spare parts in these locations continuously since 1995. In 2010, service operations were moved from Warsaw to Annopol to Karpin. The project called "Construction of a new truck service station with equipment" received funding under the Regional Operational Program of the Masovian Voivodeship. In 2013, an agreement was signed regarding Renault after-sales service, thus Intruck services in Karpin and Radom became Authorized Volvo and Renault Trucks Truck Service. The company meets all applicable Dealer Standards. Services in Radom and Karpin also obtained GVS (Original Volvo Service) certificates. The quality management system according to ISO 9001: 2008 has been operating continuously since 2004, regularly audited by Lloyd's Register Quality Assurance. Strategic locations on the E67 / S8 transit road (to the Baltic States and Russia) in Karpin, 20 km from Warsaw and on the E77 / 7 national road in Radom allow our clients easy access to the services offered. In both branches of the company there are fully equipped repair stands, daily spare parts warehouses as well as VTC Vehicle Sales Departments and VFS Financial Services Department. Currently, Intruck employs 50 experienced employees who are additionally covered by the permanent training system within Volvo and Renault Trucks Academy.
