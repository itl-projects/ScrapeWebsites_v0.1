Dear customers, Despite the difficult situation in which we have all found ourselves, and meeting the need for continuity of supply, we would like to ensure that we will make every effort to keep your vehicles in motion. We are prepared and properly equipped so that you can safely use our services. Welcome to our services. Please be advised that as part of preventive measures we have introduced obligatory temperature measurement for all persons (employees, clients, suppliers) entering and entering the Intruck premises. The measurement is made at the entry barrier by a security guard. Please be advised that from May 1, 2020 for a period of 3 months we are introducing a limited amount of working time. This results in a new schedule of service hours: Monday 8: 00-17: 00 Tuesday-Friday 8: 00-14: 00 break 15: 00-21: 00 Saturday 8: 00-15: 00 In order to disinfect and exchange employees on Tuesday - Friday, we introduce a break between 14:00 and 15:00. This is to minimize the number of employees remaining on the site at the same time. Haweka AXIS 4000 The AXIS 4000 device is an innovative product of the HAWEKA company. This top product was created thanks to the company's many years of experience in the production of portable devices for measuring the chassis geometry and truck frame. The high-quality system enables quick and precise measurements. The high demands on geometry measurements combined with the flexibility and accuracy of measuring techniques have led to the further development of these procedures. The result is a geometry measurement system that matches modern accuracy and service standards. See also: Investigation of truck geometry. Accident repair of trucks. About INTRUCK.
